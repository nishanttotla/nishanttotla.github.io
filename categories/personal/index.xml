      <title>Red Hairing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little over two weeks ago, I got my hair colored red. Not completely, just highlights, but
very prominent highlights. Nothing unique because millions of people do this sort
of thing, so the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing about it is because I can.
Kind of the same reason &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I colored my hair.
It had been on my mind since last year, but the stars started aligning a month ago when
a friend referred me to a place in Oakland. After a brief consultation with Megan&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:f8033754994359e6d66edbf4cd616350:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:f8033754994359e6d66edbf4cd616350:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I
narrowed down on the style and colors (it was between red and blue). A week later, I
went ahead and did it, picking ruby red on the day of. I shared every step of the process
on my Instagram account, but deliberately left out the final result, so I could see
reactions first-hand! Enough people have seen it now, so I can finally share a photo and
some of the reactions. (I kept track, hah!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what people have told me so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From general compliments or questions&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúLooks great‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it would look so good on you!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúRed suits you!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat motivated you?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;to extreme surprise (that was my dad)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú‡§¨‡•á‡§ü‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ?!‚Äù (Son, what have you done?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and smartass quips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat&amp;rsquo;s a cherry on top‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHi Weasley‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and some comments that were certainly not complimentary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind, but you look like a lorry driver from India‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs looking at you on the street‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;to the best one (coming from the lead actress of the Monsoon Wedding musical, on opening night)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I saw your hair from the stage! I was looking down and thinking this dude has red hair!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst of the lot though probably was when someone didn&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge the change,
because honestly it&amp;rsquo;s a form of expression and one of the best ways to express
yourself is through your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

      <title>On Being a Tourist in India</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/on-being-tourist-in-india/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 12:59:04 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/on-being-tourist-in-india/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got back to California after spending four full weeks in India. My
previous trip was two years ago, at the end
of 2014. Until moving to the US in 2012, I&amp;rsquo;d only ever lived in India.
Immediately after moving, life in California seemed very attractive, especially by
virtue of the things India could not offer (primarily better facilities,
a more peaceful lifestyle, and opportunities for individual growth). Whenever I visited
India after that, I&amp;rsquo;d often complain about the lack of infrastructure, pollution,
poor traffic, general disorder, and a host of other problems that might
affect any developing country. Typical NRI behavior, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip was so different though! It was my first proper
long vacation in over four years, although that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain everything. Over the last
two years, my life in the US hasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly been a smooth ride, and I&amp;rsquo;ve felt
increasing loneliness, conflated with other personal struggles, including those
with healthcare and bureaucracy. All of that has surely dulled the sheen that
California once held for me. It&amp;rsquo;s not a radical idea that each place has its
problems, but to truly feel and internalize it, and move past the
first world fetishism that many in India grow up with is quite
empowering. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been extremely fortunate in the last 2-3 years to
have traveled to multiple places and made friends with people
from diverse backgrounds.
As a result, I find that I&amp;rsquo;m quite willing to look past trivial (and
sometimes even big) inconveniences and focus on the positives whenever I travel
to a new place. Once again, none of this is very unique, and seasoned travelers
are often quite patient people (I&amp;rsquo;m neither).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I felt compelled to write about this is that adopting a different attitude
made my recent India experience extremely positive. On an absolute level, the India
I went to did not feel remarkably different. Some infrastructure had improved for
sure, but a lot still felt the same. Traffic was noticeably worse, air quality poor,
and the streets dirty. These aren&amp;rsquo;t new problems, as any Indian will tell you, and
they&amp;rsquo;ve annoyed me a lot in the past. This time though, I had decided to travel like
I&amp;rsquo;d travel to any other country &amp;ndash; as a tourist. This might feel like a small thing,
but it was an epiphany. I found it easier to ignore a lot of the negative
aspects, and focus on the good things &amp;ndash; and India does have a lot of good things
to offer. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;d get tired of being in India after about three
weeks and want to return, but this time I did not quite feel like coming back. Of
course, going to India is different from visiting any other country, since I&amp;rsquo;ve
grown up there, and it remains one of the likely countries I could move to in the
future. Still, this new attitude was helpful with realizing what really mattered
and what was tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to add the disclaimer that all of this says nothing about
actually living in India&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, this is not a good attitude to adopt
if one is living in a place, since it can very easily breed apathy. Still, as I
continue to evaluate whether or not I want to move to India in the near future,
this helped me think more clearly and filter out the unimportant considerations.
Without that, I&amp;rsquo;m predisposed to hyperbolizing annoyances and never creating a
balanced picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;I often complain that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to live as an independent adult in India, since I left right after college.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>2016 Year in Review</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/2016-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 01:20:02 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/2016-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Precisely a year ago, I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/off-to-hawaii&#34;&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; to try and
regain some sanity after what was a terrible 2015.
It offered little apart from endless pain, suffering, depression,
lack of community, and an uncontrollable feeling of helplessness.
So much so that the second half of the Hawaii trip was full of
panic attacks and attempts to cut the trip short. I was due to start a new job upon returning, and my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis was still pending. I had no idea how I was going
to deal after getting back, manage personal relationships, and stop feeling
that life was pointless every other day&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 for me was a story in two parts &amp;ndash; pre-September, and post. The first part was
incredibly hard with a few positive blips, while the second was rosy,
with renewed hope going into 2017. I&amp;rsquo;m going to avoid any mention of politics
in this post, even though the events of the year deeply affected me on a personal level.
Although 2016 was painful to live through, it will be memorable. This is a feeling
I had failed to experience for several years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;master-s-thesis:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of my woes was my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, which had dragged out for too long. After
failing to finish it at the end of 2015 and getting on filing fee status&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, expecting
to get done with it by February. But lack of progress for extended periods (in part due
to severe depression), coupled with a full-time job, and spending most of my free time
struggling with the thesis was a recipe for disaster. I failed to finish it by the May
deadline, had to register for the summer session (and pay nearly $2000 for it). Despite
finally managing to make good progress by the end of July and get a draft ready,
my committee refused to sign it, and the EECS department showed an immense lack
of desire to help me out. This left me looking at a $16000 tuition payment for the Fall
semester. I fought the bureaucracy and it was only in mid-November that I managed
to get the thesis submitted, in time to extend my immigration status, without which
I&amp;rsquo;d be forced to leave the country. The details of that
will be the subject of another post, but if there&amp;rsquo;s a lesson to be learned, it is that
&lt;em&gt;the department is not your friend&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/commencement.gif&#34; style=&#34;width:70%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Commencement - Pradeep walked on the same day&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, after over four years of struggle at UC Berkeley, I&amp;rsquo;m finally out of that
depressing environment and looking at better things, with at least a degree to show.
I even got to walk for commencement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this front, the year was mostly bad. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned depression a few times
already, but 2016 was remarkable because I&amp;rsquo;m
finally ending a year on a reasonably good note. If the first half was about
lack of motivation, often to the extent of death ideation, then the second half
presented a renewed faith in my own abilities, along with a future that I at least
want to consider. Thanks to input from my girlfriend and some close friends, I also
got the opportunity to deeply introspect and work on personal flaws that have
always caused me great anxiety. Health issues for someone very close to me
were also a factor in an utterly disappointing time for the first part of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I continued to work on my chronic physical injuries, with the hope of
one day getting back to endurance running and biking. I have a pretty solid understanding
of shoulder and hip anatomy as a result, and have tried literally every rehab technique
out there. Hopefully 2017 is the year I get a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working at Docker as a software engineer in early 2016.
I recovered some of the productivity I lost during grad
school, and got several new opportunities and experiences along the way. For one,
I learned a lot about working on open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/github.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;My GitHub profile has never looked greener&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I got to &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/conference-travel-2016&#34;&gt;travel to multiple conferences&lt;/a&gt;
and give talks. These were among the primary reasons I had joined Docker in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/talk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;First conference talk, at ContainerCamp 2016, London&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were slow periods too, but the year was overall a positive change on the work front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all problems, 2016 was one of the best years for travel. Traveling was
easier since I had more money, opportunities, and time (post September).
I did make several trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boulder and Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (May) for a long weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seattle and Olympic National Park, Washington (June) for DockerCon, extended the trip by a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crater Lake National Park, Oregon (July) for a random weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/colorado.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/craterlake.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;White snow at 12,000ft in Rocky Mountain National Park, and deep blue water at Crater Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London, UK (September) for ContainerCamp, spent 4 extra days exploring the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Louis, Missouri (September) for Strange Loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike camping trip to Samuel P Taylor State Park (September)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin, Germany (October) for the Docker Distributed Systems Summit, plus 3 extra days to explore the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mendocino, California (October) for a relaxing weekend getaway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/london.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/bikecamping.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/berlin.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;London, start of the bike camping trip in SF, festival of lights at the Berliner Dom, California coastline in Mendocino&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portland, Oregon (November) for a friend&amp;rsquo;s bachelor trip weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maui, Hawaii (November) for the Thanksgiving break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo, Japan (December) for vacation, and (finally) a new country for 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India (December), also for vacation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/portland.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/maui.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/tokyo.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:80%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hipster Indian food in Portland, stunning ridges in Maui, street market in Tokyo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this includes 3 international trips, 4 national parks, and several new
cities. I also spend a lot of time exploring locally in Oakland and San Francisco.
Up until the late May trip to Colorado, the only travel I had done was a weekend
trip to Seattle in March, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad with the way things turned out in the second
half of the year&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-highlights:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fulfilled a long standing dream of watching Arsenal play at the Emirates stadium. During my trip to London in September, I managed to get a ticket to the Arsenal vs Southampton game and thoroughly enjoyed it. Interestingly, just the month before, I&amp;rsquo;d watched the team play MLS All-Stars during their US tour but had no idea I&amp;rsquo;d actually be traveling to London soon after!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/emirates.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Arsenal vs Southampton at the Emirates Stadium in September&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a short Docker tutorial for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine&#34;&gt;Netmag&lt;/a&gt;, a UK magazine. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done something like this, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited! The issue goes on sale in late January 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some close friends got married (and several others got engaged). Wedding season was a lot of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After several years of being indifferent, I celebrated my birthday (in difficult circumstances too, following my thesis rejection!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vasuki, Vaishnavi, and I organized a Bollywood costume themed Diwali party at our apartment, the first such party I&amp;rsquo;ve been part of organizing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My adventure of the year was jumping into the freezing cold water of Crater Lake, after failing to carry swimming shorts but judging that the opportunity was not to be missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I made the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/why-i-moved-to-static-website&#34;&gt;current version of my website and blog&lt;/a&gt; this year. It was a lot of work, but has been a net positive effort because it encouraged me to write more easily and frequently (hopefully more next year).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a private list of specific goals to pursue to next year, but the most
important thing I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to is settling down. For
too long now, life has felt like someone else in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat, and I want to
end that. Hopefully, that will free up some time to devote to things I actually care
about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;The irony here is that I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty privileged and &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo;, and that only adds up to a lot of guilt. One of my major goals is to get over this chronic depression.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;A special kind of student registration that you can avail when only a thesis is due, and all course requirements are done. The upside is that you&amp;rsquo;re no longer required to pay tuition and can get a job.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a curious thing how despite being utterly depressed for long periods, my travelogue is pretty elaborate. It was more chance than anything that I managed to cover as much ground as I did, but satisfying that I took the opportunities that came my way. When I tried to reach out to a friend saying I was really sad, he mentioned that&amp;rsquo;s not at all how my Instagram profile looked like. Now you have another example of the pain hidden behind glittery social media profiles.

      <title>2015 Year in Review</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/2015-year-in-review/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Are you already sick of people writing their yearly review posts? I bet! I‚Äôm going to add more more to the pile though, but mostly as a milestone for myself, and for others who might find value in reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I have to say that 2015 has been the most unusual year of my life. I‚Äôve experienced many different things and changed a lot as a person. This is also the year when I finally decided and went through the process of quitting grad school to venture out into the real world. I‚Äôll try to keep it short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;depression-and-personal-growth:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Depression and Personal Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started in late 2014 as a series of depressive episodes turned into a full-blown depression that lasted for most of 2015. It affected nearly every area of my life, most notably my ability to work. Research suffered and I failed to make any meaningful progress, which in turn only made it harder to recover. My ability to make friends, and keep in touch with existing ones also took a hit as I became increasingly lonely. It took a lot of time to accept this and start taking steps to get better, and I‚Äôm still on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it has been a very troubling period where I came in touch with some of the darkest emotions in me, it has also been full of trememdous learning about self and personal growth. It taught me to take a hard look at my priorities. It showed me which people are really well-wishers and were willing to help when I needed it most. I realized the value of community and investing in relationships, something I‚Äôd never thought important because I believed I could survive on my own. It also made me a lot more empathetic to the suffering of other people, and I think I emerge from it a better person. Probably more cynical, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;world-view:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;World View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a consequence of my struggles, I became much more attuned to the struggles of other people, in particular underprivileged groups. I realized that the world isn‚Äôt always a fair place, and is heavily biased in favor of those already predisposed to success. Causes like equality (gender, race etc.) gained new meaning for me, and my opinions of right and wrong evolved to a large extent. I also started participating in discussions and voicing opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think I was ever as productive in grad school as I would like, but 2015 turned out to be the tipping point. Things got to a stage where my lack of progress had become a chronic problem and nothing I was trying seemed to work. Changing research groups didn‚Äôt seem quite possible then, so leaving grad school completely was the only plausible option. It took me a while to come to terms with the decision, but it became clearer as time passed. I had some great interviews and got several job offers which was good for my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/docker&#34;&gt;@docker&lt;/a&gt; later this year! Super excited, looking forward to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aluzzardi&#34;&gt;@aluzzardi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vieux&#34;&gt;@vieux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abronan&#34;&gt;@abronan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sam_alba&#34;&gt;@sam_alba&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/647555264699219968&#34;&gt;September 25, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the battle was only half won, and consistent efforts to gain back my lost productivity have finally bore some fruit, and I feel confident I can do great things with my new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel wise, 2015 was a decent year. I managed to stick to my resolution of visiting at least one new country each year. This year, it was an amazing summer trip to the UK (England+Scotland), and a (just concluded) winter trip to Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Goodbye Hawaii, it&amp;#39;s been a meaningful trip! Time to go back to normal life and start afresh. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NzS1Pnftk4&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NzS1Pnftk4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Traveler Boy (@nrt_travel) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nrt_travel/status/682771096320409602&#34;&gt;January 1, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few other short trips too, but not nearly enough! The overwhelming guilt that comes from not being productive is a big adversary of travel, and I‚Äôve been trying hard to control it. Still, I‚Äôm proud and happy for the travel I managed to do, but looking forward to all the more that I will do in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped running long distances after the hip injury I had in late 2014, hoping to get to its root before starting again. I picked up biking instead and started riding long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having learned my lesson from running, I built up mileage too much too soon, and ended up with an overuse injury to the back that would keep me out for much of the year. What finally did put me in touch with my body was picking up Yoga, which not only showed me how ill-prepared I was to go through extreme physical stresses, but also gave me a framework to think about how to treat my body and be gentle with it. Most importantly, to listen to my body. Mental stress also contributed most likely, and is as much part of overall recovery as anything else. I hope to take these learnings into the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-2016:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;In 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my work is laid out clearly. I need to rediscover my productivity by performing well at work, while simultaneously giving more importance to community both in my personal and professional lives. I will travel more. I will recover from my injuries and respect my body. I will remember to apply everything I‚Äôve learned the hard way this year to similar problems. Life isn‚Äôt going to be any easier, but I will be wiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I write this post next year, I hope there will be more positivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Off to Hawaii - a Good End to a Miserable Year</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/off-to-hawaii/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2015 will go down as the worst year in my life so far, no doubts about that! It has been a year when I suffered a lot, learned some hard lessons, and had to face several uncomfortable truths about myself. I‚Äôve battled terrifying depression and felt things I wasn‚Äôt ready to handle. As painful as that has been, I‚Äôm glad to be ending the year right ‚Äì by taking a break from everything, and heading to Hawaii on my first real solo trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Booked tickets to Hawaii today, leaving in 5 days!! üôåüôåüôå Now gotta figure the rest out. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/678304771921436672&#34;&gt;December 19, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm leaving tomorrow, for 8 days, and relishing the opportunity to relax, contemplate, and plan for the coming year. I‚Äôm going to spend a few days in Honolulu, and the rest living on an organic farm not far from some hills. I plan to run, hike, eat, read, and swim at the beach. I‚Äôll do what I want, go where I like. There will be plenty of time to write too, and prepare for my new job which I start soon after returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully intend to cut down social media use during the stay, and concentrate on the moment. The stress and poor lifestyle during 2015 have diminished my focus and severely affected my ability to think deeply about hard problems. I want to start recovering some of that. For starters, I have a book to read, along with some exciting new research papers. Hoping to have a great trip!&lt;/p&gt;
