      <description>July 14 &amp;ndash; 16, 2017  3 days  I was in Portland this weekend for a friend&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bachelorette party&amp;rdquo;. Quotes because this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional bachelorette party at all (ask me why). We spent three days in the city, mostly exploring the food scene and urban landscape. This was my second trip to Portland, and this time I could strongly feel the laid-back vibe the city has. People really love their lunches and dinners and leisurely coffees and local markets.</description>

      <description>Today I finally experienced an hour in a floatation tank, also known to some as a sensory isolation tank. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about this for a long time and it is the kind of thing that naturally makes me curious. The basic question is
 How will the brain function when all external stimuli are removed?
 To achieve the conditions for this, you step into a lightless (and I mean &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t-see-your-hands-at-two-inches-away-dark&amp;rdquo;) and soundproof tank filled to a depth of about 10 inches with high concentration Epsom salt solution.</description>

      <description>November 24 &amp;ndash; 28, 2016  4 days  I visited Maui with V during the Thanksgiving break in 2016. It was a late booking and most tickets to Hawaii were rather expensive, but then we decided to not return on the Sunday after Thanksgiving (which is what most people do) and it suddenly made the tickets a few hundred dollars cheaper and the trip possible.
In total, we spent four days on the island, which was a good amount of time to cover a lot of ground.</description>
