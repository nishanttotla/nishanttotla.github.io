      <description>As a software engineer, I spend a lot of time across multiple terminal instances. When I started working at Docker, there were several times when I learned a new way to accomplish something, and then needed to do it again a few weeks later, only to realize I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember the right commands or arguments. Since regular bash history (the history command) isn&amp;rsquo;t very reliable across terminal instances or reboots, I needed a better solution to maintain all history persistently.</description>

      <title>Signing Git Commits with a GPG Key</title>

      <description>In my last post, I described public key encryption and how you can generate new PGP keys using Keybase. That was just a start, and PGP keys have several uses. One of the first things I wanted to do was to start signing all my Git commits.
Why Sign Commits? Recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above) introduced the ability to sign commits using a GPG key. A signed commit can be verified to make sure that you wrote the code that you claim you did.</description>

      <title>Playing with Keybase.io</title>

      <description>I have to admit, despite having spent so many years studying Computer Science, my understanding of security and modern best practices is pretty shabby. I&amp;rsquo;m fixing that now, and it was a perfect opportunity when a friend invited me to try keybase.io. It&amp;rsquo;s still an Alpha product, and invite-only (or sign up and join the waitlist). I learned new things while trying it out, and wanted to write about it.</description>

      <title>Building Code Inside a VM</title>

      <description>This post is based on the workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve been employing during my day to day work at Docker. When I first started, I chose to get a 13&amp;rsquo; Macbook Pro, which is a pretty solid machine to own. But a lot of the compiling and testing I needed to do needed a Linux distribution, so I had two options &amp;ndash; install Linux or use a Virtual Machine (VM). Installing VirtualBox and using a simple Ubuntu VM is a fairly straightforward solution, but there were two problems</description>
