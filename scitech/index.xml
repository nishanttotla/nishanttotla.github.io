      <title>Signing Git Commits with a GPG Key</title>

      <description>In my last post, I described public key encryption and how you can generate new PGP keys using Keybase. That was just a start, and PGP keys have several uses. One of the first things I wanted to do was to start signing all my Git commits.
Why Sign Commits? Recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above) introduced the ability to sign commits using a GPG key. A signed commit can be verified to make sure that you wrote the code that you claim you did.</description>

      <description>I have to admit, despite having spent so many years studying Computer Science, my understanding of security and modern best practices is pretty shabby. I&amp;rsquo;m fixing that now, and it was a perfect opportunity when a friend invited me to try keybase.io. It&amp;rsquo;s still an Alpha product, and invite-only (or sign up and join the waitlist). I learned new things while trying it out, and wanted to write about it.</description>

      <description>This post is based on the workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve been employing during my day to day work at Docker. When I first started, I chose to get a 13&amp;rsquo; Macbook Pro, which is a pretty solid machine to own. But a lot of the compiling and testing I needed to do needed a Linux distribution, so I had two options &amp;ndash; install Linux or use a Virtual Machine (VM). Installing VirtualBox and using a simple Ubuntu VM is a fairly straightforward solution, but there were two problems</description>

      <title>Distributed Systems Resources</title>

      <description>I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.
In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful.</description>
