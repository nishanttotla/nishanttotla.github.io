<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/02/indias-hospitals-are-filling-up-with-desperate-americans/">India’s Hospitals Are Filling Up With Desperate Americans</a> [Foreign Policy] &ndash; A perspective on the medical tourism industry in India which talks
about how this impacts healthcare access for poorer Indians.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/united-states-south-india-can-southern-collective-get-us-better-deal-delhi-46501">United States of South India: Can a southern collective get us a better deal from Delhi?</a> [The News Minute] &ndash; Economic arguments for why the states of southern India need to make a
united political stand. While I&rsquo;m normally not in favor of amplifying regionalist arguments of any kind, this fits in well somewhere in the debate of the cultural
imposition by the Central Government on the rest of India.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/union-pool-the-brooklyn-bar-thats-perfect-for-hookups.html">How Union Pool Became the Horny Utopia of 2000s Williamsburg</a> [The Cut] &ndash; I love stories about the gritty underbellies of urban areas.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gamergate-fbi-file-2017-2">FBI&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gamergate&rsquo; file says prosecutors didn&rsquo;t charge men who sent death threats to female video game fans — even when suspects confessed</a> [Business Insider] &ndash; The next time someone says that the law
appropriately handles cases of sexual harassment, show them this.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/07/is-everything-you-think-you-know-about-depression-wrong-johann-hari-lost-connections">Is everything you think you know about depression wrong?</a> [The Guardian] &ndash; The title is a little clickbaity, and part of a series of posts in The Guardian
about the excesses of neurochemical treatments for mental health diseases. Obviously,
cultural context is crucial, and this topic is sensitive, so read it with caution. If you&rsquo;re
someone who has been helped by medication, this might challenge your story, whereas for those
who haven&rsquo;t found relief even through medication, there might be interesting ideas in there.
In general, our medical, cultural, and social narratives around mental health are constantly
shifting, and this adds another perspective to the discussion.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28957268-queer">Queer: A Graphic History</a> &ndash; A graphic novel on queer activism, theory, and their history. There is a lot of information
densely packed in a few pages, but it&rsquo;s all been very revelatory for me, and it&rsquo;s one of those books with the potential to change the way you think. I have been highly recommending it to everyone I know. Of course, the book has valid critiques against it
too, but it serves as a good introduction to a lot of complex ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Long Distance (Parts <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/long-distance">One</a> and <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/103-long-distance-part-ii">Two</a>) [Reply All] &ndash; When was
the last time you listened to a podcast that was nearly a thriller? These two Reply All episodes were so thrilling that I found myself going through the nearly 100 minutes in bits and pieces whenever I could find time during the day. When a telephone scammer calls the podcast host Alex Goldman, the team chases the scammers down. All the way to New Delhi.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a> became my favorite Podcast in January. Here are some of the episodes that stood out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/half-measures/">Half Measures</a> [99% Invisible] &ndash; A history of why the metric system just doesn&rsquo;t catch on in the US. Like with most things, the answer is complicated and contains a dose of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; à la America.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-athletic-brassiere/">The Athletic Brassiere</a> [99% Invisible] &ndash; The ubiquitous sports bra wasn&rsquo;t always as ubiquitous. It&rsquo;s a fairly recent invention that
changed the way women (and people with breasts) exercise.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/repackaging-the-pill/">Repackaging the Pill</a> [99% Invisible] &ndash; The birth control pill was the first &ldquo;lifestyle pill&rdquo;, one that was prescribed to adults not suffering from any particular condition. It was also one that patients demanded from doctors, as opposed to doctors prescribing based on their
judgment. Among all this, its packaging has evolved and influenced how other drugs
are sold and advertised currently in America.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="movies-and-tv-shows">Movies and TV Shows</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5918074/">A Death in the Gunj</a> &ndash; It was a matter of chance
that I decided to watch this movie on my flight from Mumbai to San Francisco. I&rsquo;m glad I did, because it was a very captivating story about a family vacation focusing on themes
of isolation, depression, grief, harassment, and much more, all laid out very eloquently.
What&rsquo;s more, at the end I learned that this was a directorial debut for Konkona Sen Sharma,
whom I really admire.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5615116/">Dear Dad</a> &ndash; A dad comes out as gay to his son
during a roadtrip with the son. The topic has been handled with more sensitivity than most portrayals of homosexuality in Hindi movies, even if it&rsquo;s not quite perfect. The movie also briefly and subtly touches upon ideas of masculinity. It was good to see Arvind Swamy after a long time (he plays the dad).</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/">The Post</a> &ndash; A thoroughly enjoyable dramatization
of events during Nixon&rsquo;s presidency, featuring a war between the press and the government,
told in the context of the the history of the Washington Post becoming a public company.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4975722/">Moonlight</a> &ndash; A refreshing take on the life
of a young African American gay man. Refreshing because you don&rsquo;t have big budget
mainstream movies with this kind of representation on a regular basis. It also
won the Academy Award for best picture last year.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<ul>
<li>India &ndash; While I missed my goal of traveling to a new country in 2017,
I somewhat made up for it by going to new places in India. In particular, I went to
Bikaner (for a wedding) which was my first time visiting western Rajasthan. I also visited
Tirupati in southern Andhra Pradesh, again my first time in that part of the country.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfYRzxeMdGs">The US medical system is still haunted by slavery</a> &ndash; This video is mindblowing. It focuses mostly on gynecology and related areas of medicine. It&rsquo;s a short video (under 9 minutes) and talks about the excruciating surgeries and experiments inflicted upon enslaved (black) women by several doctors in the Antebellum South, among other things. While this may not be surprising because the history of medicine is built on many such stories, it is still worth analyzing said history because of the many invisible ways in which it shapes our current biases and understanding. This video touches upon a little bit of that as well.</li>
