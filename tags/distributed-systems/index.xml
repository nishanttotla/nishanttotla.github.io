      <description>I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.
In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful.</description>
