      <description>Was the hype worth it? YES! A hundred times YES! Nothing could really have prepared me for how spectacular and overwhelming it would be to witness a total solar eclipse for the first time. It was beautiful, strange, and emotionally evocative all at the same time.
Having made plans and reservations just about in time for the trip to Oregon, I was naturally looking forward to the event, as were millions of others who traveled far to see totality across the United States.</description>
