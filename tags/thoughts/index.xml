      <title>Deciding to Stop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader with a short attention span, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to read a lot more books
than I currently manage. So I&amp;rsquo;m like the armchair analyst who dreams of changing the
world &amp;ndash; tons of ambition, but lack of skills (and possibly desire?). A recurrent
problem for me has been that I start some books, partly or nearly finish them, have
no interest in continuing, but can&amp;rsquo;t start other books until I finish the earlier ones.
Obviously there&amp;rsquo;s merit to sticking it out, but more often than not, time could be better
spent reading books out of which I could derive most value, rather than struggle with ones
that are neither adding much value nor getting done (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19438058-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance&#34;&gt;Robert Pirsig&lt;/a&gt;). What I&amp;rsquo;m suggesting isn&amp;rsquo;t
groundbreaking, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember &amp;ndash; the guilt and pressure of finishing
a book is a strong deterrent to moving on and reading more books that you can actually
finish. The same applies to TV shows, jobs, relationships (but we won&amp;rsquo;t go there).
It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to simply view all of this as the sunk cost fallacy, but stating out
the special case is always useful. That&amp;rsquo;s why we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2014/jul/07/hawking-index-give-up-on-books-capital-fifty-shades&#34;&gt;Hawking Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Being a Tourist in India</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/on-being-tourist-in-india/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got back to California after spending four full weeks in India. My
previous trip was two years ago, at the end
of 2014. Until moving to the US in 2012, I&amp;rsquo;d only ever lived in India.
Immediately after moving, life in California seemed very attractive, especially by
virtue of the things India could not offer (primarily better facilities,
a more peaceful lifestyle, and opportunities for individual growth). Whenever I visited
India after that, I&amp;rsquo;d often complain about the lack of infrastructure, pollution,
poor traffic, general disorder, and a host of other problems that might
affect any developing country. Typical NRI behavior, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip was so different though! It was my first proper
long vacation in over four years, although that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain everything. Over the last
two years, my life in the US hasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly been a smooth ride, and I&amp;rsquo;ve felt
increasing loneliness, conflated with other personal struggles, including those
with healthcare and bureaucracy. All of that has surely dulled the sheen that
California once held for me. It&amp;rsquo;s not a radical idea that each place has its
problems, but to truly feel and internalize it, and move past the
first world fetishism that many in India grow up with is quite
empowering. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been extremely fortunate in the last 2-3 years to
have traveled to multiple places and made friends with people
from diverse backgrounds.
As a result, I find that I&amp;rsquo;m quite willing to look past trivial (and
sometimes even big) inconveniences and focus on the positives whenever I travel
to a new place. Once again, none of this is very unique, and seasoned travelers
are often quite patient people (I&amp;rsquo;m neither).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I felt compelled to write about this is that adopting a different attitude
made my recent India experience extremely positive. On an absolute level, the India
I went to did not feel remarkably different. Some infrastructure had improved for
sure, but a lot still felt the same. Traffic was noticeably worse, air quality poor,
and the streets dirty. These aren&amp;rsquo;t new problems, as any Indian will tell you, and
they&amp;rsquo;ve annoyed me a lot in the past. This time though, I had decided to travel like
I&amp;rsquo;d travel to any other country &amp;ndash; as a tourist. This might feel like a small thing,
but it was an epiphany. I found it easier to ignore a lot of the negative
aspects, and focus on the good things &amp;ndash; and India does have a lot of good things
to offer. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;d get tired of being in India after about three
weeks and want to return, but this time I did not quite feel like coming back. Of
course, going to India is different from visiting any other country, since I&amp;rsquo;ve
grown up there, and it remains one of the likely countries I could move to in the
future. Still, this new attitude was helpful with realizing what really mattered
and what was tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to add the disclaimer that all of this says nothing about
actually living in India&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, this is not a good attitude to adopt
if one is living in a place, since it can very easily breed apathy. Still, as I
continue to evaluate whether or not I want to move to India in the near future,
this helped me think more clearly and filter out the unimportant considerations.
Without that, I&amp;rsquo;m predisposed to hyperbolizing annoyances and never creating a
balanced picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;I often complain that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to live as an independent adult in India, since I left right after college.

      <title>Learning about Empathy</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/learning-about-empathy/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2015 15:46:09 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/learning-about-empathy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Empathy is such a simple concept to understand, yet so difficult to practice! Kids are taught about it. The word itself is lazily thrown around, assuming everyone knows how to empathize, that it’s something we’re naturally good at. Well we’re not! Even if we care enough to look outside our own busy lives to try and want to empathize with someone, it’s too easy to fall into the trap of making judgments or believing we know everything about another person’s situation. Empathy is especially tough because it requires us to not only understand a different person, but also to set aside our own biases and keep an open mind, all of which are notoriously difficult things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having gone through a rough patch involving several personal struggles over the last two years, and distinctly feeling that nobody understood my situation, I’ve realized an important lesson. Empathy is defined as “the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person”, and that is really the key – &lt;strong&gt;understanding feelings&lt;/strong&gt; – as opposed to just understanding the problem at hand or trying to find a solution. The best way to do it is simpler than you can imagine, you just have to ask! Think about it, how many people have asked you in the last few days how you feel? Have you asked anyone? We all struggle with the stresses of modern life, but rarely ask each other how we feel. To add to it, we immediately make up our minds about others, and this only blocks out further communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering to focus on how someone is feeling rather than what they’re talking about, or how they’re behaving, helps me better understand and help people. This is especially valuable while dealing with conflicts – someone might be upset at you but if you understood how they felt, your opinion and even reaction might change. If a friend berated you for being late, you might be upset because she’s being too touchy. But if you knew that she lost her job that day and is feeling down, not only are you likely to let it go, but might also alter your behavior and try to make her feel better instead of getting upset yourself. For someone like me who usually tends to get upset quickly, this is a VERY useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who empathize with others are more likable and less likely to pick up extended conflicts. I believe lack of empathy is a prime ingredient in a lot of the hatred and stereotyping that is perpetrated today. Everyone conveniently judges others from their own safe points of view. I’m guilty too, but have been trying hard to correct it. While empathy is not the solution to every problem in the world, it can certainly alleviate some!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the only takeaway from this post is to always keep your mind open for what the other person is feeling. If you can’t figure it out, remember to ask! People can be pleasantly surprised when you do.&lt;/p&gt;
