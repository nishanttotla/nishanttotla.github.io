      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work at caf√©s a lot, and like observing people. I try to not be creepy, but it&amp;rsquo;s intriguing to note how people do things, imagine what they might be working on, or their story. One thing in particular I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved is to see the act of people packing their bags &amp;ndash; laptop, pens, glasses etc. It&amp;rsquo;s weird, but recently I consciously realized this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed that I also like to watch hands writing, typing, or performing a number of other complex tasks that are really accessible only to human hands. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I&amp;rsquo;m sharing this, but is there anyone else out there who feels the same?&lt;/p&gt;
