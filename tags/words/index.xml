      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a word that struck me immediately. I found it on one of those &lt;a href=&#34;http://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2016/02/40-words-for-emotions-youve-felt-but-couldnt-explain/3/&#34;&gt;listicles&lt;/a&gt;
that pull up obscure words that mean very specific things, and then advertize to
young adults trying to make sense of their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adronitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n. frustration with how long it takes to get to know someone—spending the first few weeks chatting in their psychological entryway, with each subsequent conversation like entering a different anteroom, each a little closer to the center of the house—wishing instead that you could start there and work your way out, exchanging your deepest secrets first, before easing into casualness, until you’ve built up enough mystery over the years to ask them where they’re from, and what they do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to bet this is not even a real word &amp;ndash; searching didn&amp;rsquo;t yield
conclusive results. But the meaning, and imagery it depicts, is spot on, and something
I&amp;rsquo;ve strongly felt about making friends lately.&lt;/p&gt;
