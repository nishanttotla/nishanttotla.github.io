&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:ba0e22dee794a25c4a033332b484e270&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/10/some-troublesome-questions-for-liberals-on-borders&#34;&gt;Some Troublesome Questions for Liberals on Borders&lt;/a&gt; [Current Affairs] &amp;ndash; As the last few months continue to heavily challenge our belief systems and ideals, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying a lot harder to consolidate my own principles, and what liberalism means for me. Immigration is being talked about a lot these days, and this article raises pertinent questions about the way we argue for it. In summary, we need to do a much better job at constructing more solid (including moral) arguments for immigration, rather than just relying on the economic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2017/02/russians-engineer-brilliant-slot-machine-cheat-casinos-no-fix/&#34;&gt;Russians Engineer a Brilliant Slot Machine Cheat &amp;ndash; And Casinos Have No Fix&lt;/a&gt; [Wired] &amp;ndash; A Russian company found a way to reverse-engineer the pseudo-random number generator algorithms of some casinos, and managed to win much more than slot machines usually give. This is the story of how they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.t5eiitm.org/2017/02/chronicle-imprisonment-foretold/&#34;&gt;A Chronicle Of An Imprisonment Foretold&lt;/a&gt; [The Fifth Estate][TW: sexual harassment] &amp;ndash; A story of sexual harassment on the IIT Madras campus. It highlights the victim&amp;rsquo;s personal experience and the ineffectiveness of systems designed to deal with cases like these. Looking back to my time at IIT Bombay, none of this comes across as a great surprise, and I can only begin to imagine the plight of students who silently suffer harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/parliaments-around-the-world-what-can-architecture-can-teach-us-about-democracy/&#34;&gt;Parliaments around the world: what can architecture teach us about democracy?&lt;/a&gt; [Hansard Society] &amp;ndash; This very intriguing article takes a look at how Parliaments are structured in countries around the world. The idea is to try and understand how political culture is shaped by architecture and also expressed through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/02/the-magical-rationalism-of-elon-musk-and-the-prophets-of-ai.html&#34;&gt;The Magical Rationalism of Elon Musk and the Prophets of AI&lt;/a&gt; [NYMag] &amp;ndash; Are those who worry about how AI will make humans irrelevant just doomsday prophets, using the power of &amp;ldquo;magical rationalism&amp;rdquo; to make the risks appear legitimate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html&#34;&gt;Announcing the first SHA1 collision&lt;/a&gt; [Google Security Blog] &amp;ndash; The Google Security team announced the first SHA-1 collision. The computation they required for it is massive, but still accessible by today&amp;rsquo;s standards, which means it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time all systems using SHA-1 need to move away from it. Also check &lt;a href=&#34;http://shattered.io/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information. This announcement was possibly overshadowed by &amp;ldquo;Cloudbleed&amp;rdquo;, the Cloudflare bug that was revealed on the same day. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read the analysis, so that&amp;rsquo;ll probably make it into the next month&amp;rsquo;s log.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:ba0e22dee794a25c4a033332b484e270&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/&#34;&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; The little-told and uplifting story of the role of black women at NASA during the 50s and 60s. As the US competed with the Soviet Union in the space race, several black women played key roles in enabling the first manned space flight and the moon mission, destroying barriers and stereotypes along the way. This is interesting particularly in contrast with the Civil Rights movement, which was at its peak during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/&#34;&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I binged through Season 2 of this gripping alternative history series, which imagines what the world might have looked like had the Allies lost WWII. Highly recommended for history buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:ba0e22dee794a25c4a033332b484e270&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to more of Zeb Bangash lately, and find this song quite beautiful. This song also reminds me of Spring, and makes me feel quite optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/277961505&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:ba0e22dee794a25c4a033332b484e270&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/&#34;&gt;Where are the Voyagers?&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A NASA JPL link that tracks the live location of the two Voyager spacecrafts. Both are interstellar spacecraft, and have been a source of fascination for me since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E41rudbp-n0&#34;&gt;Dama Dam Mast Qalandar By Runa Laila, Abida Parveen, Asha Bhosle &amp;amp; Atif Aslam&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Sharing this song in memory of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://scroll.in/article/829667/pakistan-suicide-bombing-why-isis-feels-so-threatened-by-sindhs-lal-shahbaz-qalandar-shrine&#34;&gt;horrible terror attack on the Qalandar shrine&lt;/a&gt; in Sindh, which the song&amp;rsquo;s title alludes to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shmoop.com&#34;&gt;Shmoop&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A website that contains several study guides. Particularly interesting for me are humanities topics that I do not have a great background in, such as history, literary criticism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/articles/a33897/rape-sexual-assault-survivor-perpetrator-ted-talk/&#34;&gt;This Rape Survivor And The Man Who Raped Her Have Teamed Up To Tell Their Story&lt;/a&gt; [TW: rape] &amp;ndash; Not sure how I feel about this one, but it is an unusual case of a rape victim and her rapist coming together (voluntarily) to talk about it. While their message seems agreeable (I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually seen the video itself), there are legitimate issues around providing a platform and voice to a rapist on this subject, points which this article aptly raises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some old posts here, just because I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with the backlog
from the last 4-5 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:522ff2422ef90d5eff638eb49e6ceed5&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793&#34;&gt;My President was Black&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; A really long (in six parts) and powerful article by Ta-Nehisi Coates on the rise and political career of Barack Obama. It talks about Obama&amp;rsquo;s childhood in Hawaii, the influences that shaped his outlook and policies, and the recent election &amp;ndash; all viewed from the lens of race and history as well. If there&amp;rsquo;s one long article you read this month, let this be it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://niskanencenter.org/blog/defense-liberty-cant-without-identity-politics&#34;&gt;The Defense of Liberty can&amp;rsquo;t do without Identity Politics&lt;/a&gt; [Niskanen Center] &amp;ndash; Identity politics has been recently maligned as one of the major causes of general dissatisfaction with the government. This is a solid essay that explains in good terms why Trump&amp;rsquo;s election is no reason to get rid of identity politics. In fact, we need more of it to make sure the rights of oppressed groups are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@Bahujan_Power/pioneering-a-survey-of-caste-in-the-diasporas-6e5a27cd82ef#.xx82xrhfh&#34;&gt;Spearheading a Survey of Caste in South Asian Diasporas&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; There&amp;rsquo;s some background in this article, with personal stories, and link to a survey set up by the Dalit American Foundation and co-sponsored by Ambedkar International Mission, Ambedkar Association of North America, and the Dalit American Women’s Federation. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look into how the caste system works among the Indian diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/amateur-sociology-considered-harmful/&#34;&gt;Amateur Sociology Considered Harmful&lt;/a&gt; [Things of Things] &amp;ndash; A highly recommended post on the pitfalls of amateur sociology &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s fun but we have to be much more careful about assuming it actually describes the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/for-kidney-health-roller-coaster-therapy/501278/&#34;&gt;A Health Benefit of Roller Coasters&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; This is truly wacky research. In a unique, home-spun experiment, researchers found that centripetal force could help people pass kidney stones—before they become a serious health care cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html&#34;&gt;Peter Thiel, Trump’s Tech Pal, Explains Himself&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; An interview with Peter Thiel about his behavior during the last presidential election. His responses make it evidently clear that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t fully considered the damaging positions of the candidate he supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html&#34;&gt;Democracies end when they are too democratic&lt;/a&gt; [NYMag] &amp;ndash; An article from May that I finally managed to read. While I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with all points, it now comes across as extremely prescient about the events that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.e9vzbei2p&#34;&gt;Trial Balloon for a Coup?&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; This is a speculative article that argues that the current administration&amp;rsquo;s imposition of the Muslim ban, then backing off on some points, followed by the confusion that followed was a way of testing the limits of the system. Quoting, &amp;ldquo;Yesterday was the trial balloon for a coup d’état against the United States. It gave them useful information&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jakefuentes/the-immigration-ban-is-a-headfake-and-were-falling-for-it-b8910e78f0c5#.wcck2msz1&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; that constructs a similar hypothesis &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;We’ve just tested the country’s willingness to capitulate to a fascist regime&amp;rdquo;. On the second article, I disagree with the tone that protests have limited efficacy, but agree that much bigger and stronger organization is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:522ff2422ef90d5eff638eb49e6ceed5&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched several good movies this month, though there are still more I have to catch up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4341582/&#34;&gt;Queen of Katwe&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A feel-good movie about a little girl in Uganda who&amp;rsquo;s a Chess prodigy, and goes on to rapidly achieve great success. The best part is that this is based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, who grew up in a slum in Katwe, learned to play Chess there, and eventually became an international champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4900716/&#34;&gt;Kapoor &amp;amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d watched this movie before, but watched it again on the flight back to San Francisco. I think it needs a mention, because even after the second watch, it was an extremely well-made and delicately sensitive Bollywood movie. It surely is one of my favorite Hindi movies from the new generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5946128/&#34;&gt;Dear Zindagi&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Another Hindi movie that deserves a mention. Bollywood tends to poorly treat many complex issues, and mental health remains one of them, so it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to see a generally mature movie centered around mental health issues and therapy (which is still a big taboo in India).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/&#34;&gt;La La Land&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Nominated for 14 academy awards, and every bit worth that. Each frame feels like art, and Emma Stone in particular is a very good actress. That said, there&amp;rsquo;s something ironic about a movie about saving Jazz with all-white cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some old posts here, just because I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with the backlog
from the last 4-5 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:4511ef69dc4e83813633e87570ad385e&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/09/10/five-trends-shaping-india-s-voting-landscape-pub-52870&#34;&gt;Five Trends Shaping India’s Voting Landscape&lt;/a&gt; [Carnegie Endowment] &amp;ndash; Interesting analysis of voting trends and factors affecting elections in India. It touches upon some numbers illustrating patterns around voter turnout, effect of state elections, translation of votes to seats, etc. This was written before the 2014 election though, so some of the analysis might have to be changed as a result. There are more interesting articles &lt;a href=&#34;http://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/IndiaDecides2014/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BigMeanInternet/lego-marx-de65004b8678#.ex51oew2g&#34;&gt;Lego Marx&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; This is a great read because it refines and describes very clearly the combination of intersectionality and Marxism. It talks about &amp;ldquo;materialism&amp;rdquo; as the scientific method which can be used to describe various class conflicts in the Marxism mould. It has influenced my thinking a lot recently. The article also cites an essay from the late-70s by French women’s liberation theorist Christine Delphy called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/christine-delphy-a-materialist-feminism-is-possible.pdf&#34;&gt;“A Materialist Feminism is possible”&lt;/a&gt; as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thegauntlife.blogspot.com/2016/12/running-in-trumpland.html&#34;&gt;Running in TrumpLand&lt;/a&gt; [The Gaunt Life] &amp;ndash; Sam Robinson is a long-distance runner who lives in the Bay Area. He grew up in the rural mid-west, and describes the transformation of the places he knew when young, to what they&amp;rsquo;ve become now. This is a particularly good read in the light of the recent election, and a rare perspective of someone who has actually seen and lived through the &amp;ldquo;ignored rust belt&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/magazine/what-happens-when-a-state-is-run-by-movie-stars.html&#34;&gt;What Happens When a State Is Run by Movie Stars?&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times Magazine] &amp;ndash; An old article from last year that describes the fanatical politics of Tamil Nadu. This came up in my feed again as Jayalalithaa died earlier this month, and is a fascinating read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/i-was-a-proud-non-breeder-i-changed-my-mind.html&#34;&gt;I Was a Proud Non-Breeder. Then I Changed My Mind.&lt;/a&gt; [The Cut] &amp;ndash; Article from a journalist who had vowed to be child-free at 27 but found herself changing her mind later (for her own reasons). She explains her reasons in this post. To quote from the article &amp;ldquo;Not long ago, I learned the Arabic word Ya’aburnee from a friend’s cheesy Facebook graphic. Literally, “you bury me,” it means wanting to die before a loved one so as not to have to face the world without him or her in it. It’s a word that captures exactly my feeling for my husband. Part of the reason I didn’t want kids was because I feared they’d come between us, but if he were gone, I’d be frantic to hold on to a piece of him. Grasping this didn’t make me want a baby, exactly, but it started pushing me from “no” to, well, ambivalent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/12/movie-doesn-t-exist-and-redditors-who-think-it-does&#34;&gt;The movie that doesn’t exist and the Redditors who think it does&lt;/a&gt; [NewStatesman] &amp;ndash; Over the years, hundreds of people online have shared memories of a cheesy nineties movie called “Shazaam”. There is no evidence that such a film was ever made. This article talks about the quirks of collective memory. There&amp;rsquo;s also a subreddit that abounds in things like these: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/&#34;&gt;/r/MandelaEffect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:4511ef69dc4e83813633e87570ad385e&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dilruba Na Raazi &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/avradeep.bhowmik/&#34;&gt;Avradeep&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to this song recently, calling it an earworm. He was right!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/279982238&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/&#34;&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I binged through Season 1 of this gripping alternative history series, which imagines what the world might have looked like had the Allies lost WWII. Highly recommended for history buffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:4511ef69dc4e83813633e87570ad385e&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo, Japan &amp;ndash; I finally took some vacation days and traveled to a new country for the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:4511ef69dc4e83813633e87570ad385e&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alltheflightdeals.com&#34;&gt;All the Flight Deals&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for new innovative attempts to find cheap flight deals. This new one came up on my feed, and the UX is designed to show the cheapest tickets out of an airport to &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in the world. Useful when you want to plan a vacation based on ticket availability. There are some more features as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indivisibleguide.com/&#34;&gt;Indivisible: A Practical Guide For Resisting the Trump Agenda&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A really comprehensive collection of information where former congressional staffers reveal best practices for making Congress listen. This is in response to the urgent to form a front against the racist and bigoted agenda of the incoming administration. This originally started out as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzOz3Y6D8g_MNXHNMJYAz1b41_cn535aU5UsN7Lj8X8/mobilebasic&#34;&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-crowd-sourced-guide-to-fighting-trumps-agenda&#34;&gt;New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt; describing the story behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a short Docker tutorial for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine&#34;&gt;Netmag&lt;/a&gt;, a UK magazine. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done something like this, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited! The issue goes on sale in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/videos&#34;&gt;The School of Life YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A series of eclectic and interesting short videos on various philosophical topics. The perfect content for watching during breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Alison Jackson&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Alison Jackson is a British artist, and some of her art portrays the &amp;ldquo;intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons&amp;rdquo;. These aren&amp;rsquo;t real images, but very intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://anchoreditions.com/blog/dorothea-lange-censored-photographs&#34;&gt;Dorothea Lange’s Censored Photographs of FDR’s Japanese Concentration Camps&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Dorothea Lange was hired by the U.S. government to make a photographic record of the &amp;ldquo;evacuation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;relocation&amp;rdquo; of Japanese-Americans in 1942. She was eager to take the commission, despite being opposed to the effort, as she believed &amp;ldquo;a true record of the evacuation would be valuable in the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X14HS4gLk&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Be a Sucker - 1947&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash;  The US Military produced this anti-fascist film the wake of WWII. It deconstructs the [sic] politically motivated social engineering of Germany by the Nazi regime. Pretty relevant today, and a sad reminder of how much the US has regressed in the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/&#34;&gt;/r/churning&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I recently learned of this subreddit for learning more about hacking credit card rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>August-November 2016</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Given all the travel and being busy over August to November, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get
much time to write or update the monthly log. I&amp;rsquo;m finally able to put something
together at the end of November, collecting everything for the last four months
in one place. These months have not only been eventful personally, but also politically.
The fallout of the election of Donald Trump has affected me a lot, and forced me to read
a lot more than I usually do. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover through everything in this log, and the
following one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719&#34;&gt;Has the US just given away the internet?&lt;/a&gt; [BBC News] &amp;ndash; A brief overview article that describes the background behind the recent decision to remove ICANN from US government oversight. Quoting the article, &amp;ldquo;The switch ends a transition that has essentially been in the works for around two decades, removing a dominant power the US had by circumstance rather than intention, and one which was causing friction in the international community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@theonlytoby/history-tells-us-what-will-happen-next-with-brexit-trump-a3fefd154714#.vsypl0lw8&#34;&gt;History tells us what may happen next with Brexit &amp;amp; Trump&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; Several people are eager to dismiss Donald Trump as just another Republican
president. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m extremely paranoid and afraid given the striking similarities
between Trump and many other fascist authoritarian demagogues littered throughout history.
This article (not the only one) articulates why that paranoia isn&amp;rsquo;t pointless rambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jhalderm/want-to-know-if-the-election-was-hacked-look-at-the-ballots-c61a6113b0ba#.wr4h9scx8&#34;&gt;Want to Know if the Election was Hacked? Look at the Ballots&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; A Computer Science professor from Michigan writes about how the implementation
of elections in America is extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks. While a lot of the
talk on &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; the election has already been done in mainstream media, several people
probably still treat it as science fiction. This article presents how it&amp;rsquo;s entirely
possible, and has probably already happened. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/05/us-election-recount-michigan-donald-trump-hillary-clinton&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a Guardian news story&lt;/a&gt; that shows
how the Michigan recount might be affected just by shoddy machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/11/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival/&#34;&gt;Autocracy: Rules for Survival&lt;/a&gt; [NYR Daily] &amp;ndash; Wisdom from a seasoned Putin fighter, Masha Gessen, on how to deal with a Putin-wannabe. In her own words, &amp;ldquo;I have lived in autocracies most of my life, and have spent much of my career writing about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. I have learned a few rules for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and self-respect. It might be worth considering them now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/&#34;&gt;Intellectual Hipsters and Meta-Contrarianism&lt;/a&gt; [LessWrong] &amp;ndash; An old post I&amp;rsquo;d read a long
time ago, and pulled up again recently. Based on the (mostly political) discussions over
the last few weeks, it has felt extremely relevant. I strongly recommend reading this
post. On several issues, I feel that my own behavior has shifted around from
&amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;contrarian&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;meta-contrarian&amp;rdquo; (back and forth too). The
important point is in the conclusion &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;If meta-contrarianism is a real tendency in
over-intelligent people, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should immediately abandon their beliefs;
that would just be meta-meta-contrarianism. It means that they need to recognize the
meta-contrarian tendency within themselves and so be extra suspicious and careful about
a desire to believe something contrary to the prevailing contrarian wisdom, especially
if they really enjoy doing so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of other election coverage I&amp;rsquo;ve shared on Twitter, Facebook, or in direct
messages to people. There&amp;rsquo;s also some more I&amp;rsquo;d like to add here, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/opinion/sunday/why-blue-states-are-the-real-tea-party.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/hillary-clinton-working-class/509477&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salon.com/2016/12/03/fake-news-a-fake-president-and-a-fake-country-welcome-to-america-land-of-no-context/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to get back to reading more. I&amp;rsquo;ve barely read any books this year, but I
did manage to finish one that I started way back in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird&#34;&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve read really few books all my life, much less classics. It&amp;rsquo;s a striking commentary on race and how it functions in America (including, in my opinion, up to the modern day).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to travel the following places during this time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London, UK &amp;ndash; For the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/containercamp-pwlconf-strangeloop&#34;&gt;ContainerCamp&lt;/a&gt; conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Louis, Missouri &amp;ndash; For the &lt;a href=&#34;(/blog/containercamp-pwlconf-strangeloop&#34;&gt;PWLConf and Strange Loop&lt;/a&gt;) conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin, Germany &amp;ndash; For the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/containercamp-pwlconf-strangeloop&#34;&gt;Docker Distributed Systems Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maui, Hawaii &amp;ndash; For vacation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this travel, despite being very tiring, was a great deal of fun and made me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334&#34;&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Everyone has raved about this show enough, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to write a lot, but the charm of 80s suburban America (I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of this on TV growing up) creats a nostalgia factor for a time that I never lived. It reminded me a lot of the X-Files as well. The Soundtrack is memorable too. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/175929311&#34;&gt;video link&lt;/a&gt; for references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2401256/&#34;&gt;The Night Of&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A short series that I&amp;rsquo;d label as a dark criminal justice drama. I highly recommend this to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in that kind of thing. The slow-paced movement with powerful character development makes it quite a gripping series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4818930/&#34;&gt;Waiting&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A sensible Bollywood drama that shows two individuals coping in different ways with the loss of their respective spouses, and finding friendship in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5743656/&#34;&gt;Phobia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A good Bollywood thriller, after a long time. Good performance by Radhika Apte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/&#34;&gt;Zootopia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Like most good animated movies, Zootopia is funny and well-made. The reason it stood out for me though, was because it portrays social classes really well. Think discrimination, stereotypes, oppression &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5571734/&#34;&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Another good Bollywood movie, this time a criminal justice drama, built around the issues of sexual assualt and consent. One of the more mature presentations on the topic in Bollywood, especially given its reputation of miserably failing on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wonder-bot.com/&#34;&gt;Wonder Bot&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A chat bot that you can tell something, and it&amp;rsquo;ll remember for you. Basically a natural-language KV store of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos&#34;&gt;Phile YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A series of easy to understand videos on various topics, like computer science, mathematics, philosophy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QzAl4HIXY8&#34;&gt;Coke Studio for the Deaf&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; How would a deaf person percieve and experience music? This video explores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/13/us/politics/david-mccraw-trump-letter.html&#34;&gt;The Times’s Lawyer Responds to Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Just pretty badass. With the current state of politics, we do need more fearless journalism and patronage for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:4d953b0173aaaefba5610e347008259b&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-day-i-got-my-green-card-1467385905&#34;&gt;The Day I Got My Green Card&lt;/a&gt; [The Wall Street Journal] &amp;ndash; Amidst general gloom and doom, a rare positive story about immigration. Several people (immigrants and citizens) regularly face struggles here, when it comes to issues of inclusion and acceptance in an increasingly polarized world. If you read this though, you&amp;rsquo;ll feel that a lot of luck was still involved in the outcome being positive, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ignore the immense privilege the author has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/priyaalikaelias/shame-shame-pappi-shame?utm_term=.krvo1aEB3#.qtJO1obld&#34;&gt;Dudes, You Have GOT To Stop Shaming The Women You Have Casual Sex With&lt;/a&gt; [BuzzFeed] &amp;ndash; A short article about how the idea that women can&amp;rsquo;t really handle casual sex is just a stereotype. Women can certainly want casual sex, but some men can&amp;rsquo;t seem to accept that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/05/volcanoes-cascades-quiet-lately/&#34;&gt;Why Have Volcanoes in the Cascades Been So Quiet Lately?&lt;/a&gt; [Wired] &amp;ndash; I have gradually become more and more fascinated with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Volcanoes&#34;&gt;Cascade volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; and the associated geological history. I found this article via Googling, and it briefly describes the Cascade subduction zone, following which it tries to analyze why the volcanic arc has been rather quiet lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/being-queer-iit-my-time-campus-left-me-scars-last-lifetime-46749&#34;&gt;Being queer in an IIT: ‘My time on campus left me scars to last a lifetime’&lt;/a&gt; [The News Minute] &amp;ndash; A man&amp;rsquo;s account of how his life at an IIT (in the early 2000s) was painful due to the homophobic and heteronormative culture of the time. I don&amp;rsquo;t think things were any different when I was at IIT Bombay, and feel sad for not speaking out against said culture. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, &lt;a href=&#34;http://orinam.net/student-response-campus-homophobia-bengaluru/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is another related article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/what-you-should-know-if-you-want-to-work-remotely-and-t-1783928805&#34;&gt;What You Should Know If You Want to Work Remotely and Travel the World&lt;/a&gt; [Lifehacker] &amp;ndash; A good article to read if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in satisfying your wanderlust while still keeping a full-time job that allows you to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/michael-katze-investigation?utm_term=.ve8RL5GWA#.hhZgPJBxa&#34;&gt;“He Thinks He’s Untouchable”&lt;/a&gt; [BuzzFeed] &amp;ndash; Michael Katze, famous for his studies of Ebola and the flu, ran a lab at the University of Washington where intoxication and sexual harassment went unchecked, and he misused public resources for personal gain, according to two investigations. This is another story in the line of recent revelations detailing sexual harassment on prominent university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401&#34;&gt;What is fracking and why is it controversial?&lt;/a&gt; [BBC News] &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing a lot about fracking in the news, and was curious, so googled to find this article that describes briefly what fracking is, it&amp;rsquo;s advantages, and potential negative impact. Fracking has been used in North America with a great deal of success recently, helping drive down oil prices. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_United_States&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia article covers North America in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:4d953b0173aaaefba5610e347008259b&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/&#34;&gt;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to watch this movie for a while now, and I did this week. The storyline is ridiculous and strange and makes no sense on one hand, but it was so beautiful and inspiring on the other. I would like to stick with the latter, and recommend it to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2929690/&#34;&gt;Margarita, with a Straw&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; This is a movie about a girl with cerebral palsy, and it explores her sexuality. It&amp;rsquo;s really rare to have a movie that treats disabled individuals like normal people with normal desires, and it&amp;rsquo;s very refreshing. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s also a movie that explores homosexuality in a respectable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:4d953b0173aaaefba5610e347008259b&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://forestry.io/&#34;&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A CMS for Hugo and Jekyll sites. I&amp;rsquo;ll watch this closely, if it can deliver, because the simplicity of a CMS, combined with the power of static sites could be a huge win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/&#34;&gt;ELI5: Why is it so controversial when someone says &amp;ldquo;All Lives Matter&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Black Lives Matter&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; For all the people who feel threateaned by the Black Lives Matter movement, and just keep repeating &amp;ldquo;All Lives Matter&amp;rdquo; in response, here&amp;rsquo;s a great read, with a really simple analogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go/&#34;&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; This is a new exciting augmented-reality game that I started playing this week. The idea is that you use your phone as a Pokedex to catch and battle Pokemon in the real world. Similar in principle to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ingress.com/&#34;&gt;Ingress&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched more than 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBZDmf1jSw&#34;&gt;My Dinner with Andre (We are bored)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I discovered this really articulate monologue and liked it. It seems fairly relevant, especially after I wrote about Pokémon Go above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:7f01c44aac0808d0d8513388625a0bcb&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra?utm_term=.bwwlobVyk#.gsqJBEQDP&#34;&gt;Here Is The Powerful Letter The Stanford Victim Read Aloud To Her Attacker&lt;/a&gt; [BuzzFeed] &amp;ndash; An unconscious woman was raped by a 20 year old Stanford student behind a dumpster, and he was convicted but only got jail time of 6 months as punishment. This article is powerful, and has been evoking a lot of outrage over the awful treatment that rape victims are regularly subjected to, and the leniancy of the sentence. You&amp;rsquo;ve likely seen it shared everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-medical-screenings-all-men-need-and-when-1779846310&#34;&gt;The Medical Screenings All Men Need, and When&lt;/a&gt; [Lifehacker] &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering figuring out a regular medical treatment plan (annual health checkup etc.) and this article seemed like a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-silicon-valley-nails-silicon-valley&#34;&gt;How &amp;ldquo;Silicon Valley&amp;rdquo; Nails Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; [The New Yorker] &amp;ndash; A lot of amazing behind the scenes info about how Silicon Valley (the show) is created. And in some cases, real life is even weirder than the show, even though the show is meant to be a caricature of the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/devangp/aavite-rovay-nai?utm_term=.wy3e0EKJo#.eiYYn8x4&#34;&gt;Indians are never taught to talk to their parents as adults, and that’s a problem&lt;/a&gt; [BuzzFeed] &amp;ndash; Continuing the series of some genuinely good articles on BuzzFeed, this one focuses on how interactions between Indian kids and parents are comically shallow on the emotional front, especially when the kids grow up. While this has not entirely been my experience, I can relate to some of it, and definitely have friends who can relate to all of it. It also appears that the original article appeared on a blog, then Reddit, then here, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to track down the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@violetblue/but-he-does-good-work-6710df9d9029#.uz90bya0k&#34;&gt;“But he does good work.”&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; One of the stories behind Tor project evangelist Jacob Appelbaum and the sexual harassment and rape charges against him. It also touches upon the deep rooted culture in the tech that protects harassers. Violet Blue (the author) also reveals details about her interactions with Appelbaum in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2016/06/counter-advice-for-phd.html&#34;&gt;Counter-Advice for the PhD&lt;/a&gt; [Jean Yang] &amp;ndash; A lot of successful academics give advice that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense for those who are new or struggling, because they forget what it was actually like to be in that position. This post addresses some of that, and would have been very helpful had I read it at the start of my (failed) PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/&#34;&gt;The Lack of Options for (Startup Employees’) Options&lt;/a&gt; [Andreessen Horowitz] &amp;ndash; This post from the VC firm talks about how the 10 year exercise window doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, and amounts to a &amp;ldquo;transfer&amp;rdquo; of wealth from newer employees to older ones who quit. It has been controversial this month, especially given that it does not provide any good alternative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dangelo.quora.com/10-Year-Exercise-Periods-Make-Sense?share=1&#34;&gt;10-Year Exercise Periods Make Sense&lt;/a&gt; [Quora] &amp;ndash; Adam D&amp;rsquo;Angelo, the co-founder and CEO of Quora responded to the above post, coming out in favor of the 10 year exercise window. Note that Quora was the first company to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:7f01c44aac0808d0d8513388625a0bcb&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masala Coffee is a band from Kerala. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about them, except that this cover is beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/&#34;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I first watched a bit of the show when it first came out, but didn&amp;rsquo;t find it quite appealing. But after having worked at a software startup for a few months now, I can appreciate the satire and humor much better. It&amp;rsquo;s crude, brash, over the top, and does a great job at making fun of the seemingly strange culture that pervades Silicon Valley. If you find an aspect of the show offensive or peculiar (eg. overt sexism, racism, conceit, etc.), then remember that the real thing is even weirder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/&#34;&gt;Citizenfour&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A thrilling documentary about Edward Snowden&amp;rsquo;s correspondence with the journalists who helped him break the story on government surveillance. It features all the real people involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4434004/&#34;&gt;Udta Punjab&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A chilling movie about the drug menace that&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be cripping the state of Punjab (India). It&amp;rsquo;s one of the few Bollywood movies that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sugar coat things, and presents a legitimately grim picture. Highly recommended, and glad it avoided most censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/accounts-cards/shopsafe.go&#34;&gt;ShopSafe&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Bank of America offers a program where you can create a temporary credit card online, that links to an existing card you own (one level of indirection). You can also set an expiry date and maximum (possibly recurring) limit on the card! This is extremely useful in places where you don&amp;rsquo;t trust the vendor enough to provide your real credit card number. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this extensively now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:934191705702a94fc45e2007e1bfaf5f&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rkoutnik.com/2016/04/21/implementers-solvers-and-finders.html&#34;&gt;Implementers, Solvers, and Finders&lt;/a&gt; [rkoutnik.com] &amp;ndash; This article describes three types of roles software engineers can fulfill in a company. Implementers implement solutions handed to them, solvers solve problems handed to them, finders discover those problems. It points out how most engineers only become finders when they choose the management ladder, and how there might still be hope for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@lydiapolgreen/why-people-pay-to-read-the-new-york-times-60720880e707#.n7zkrugsv&#34;&gt;Why people pay to read The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; This is a brilliant point of view, and one that fully aligns with how I think of journalism in the digital age. At a time when Facebook and social media have immense control over platforms, there is still a lot of value in good journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006&#34;&gt;Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News&lt;/a&gt; [Gizmodo] &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve long believed that the algorithms run by giant tech companies have immense power when it comes to swaying public opinion, even if inadvertently. But if there&amp;rsquo;s intent, things can get really tricky. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to have biases in news reporting, and be explicit about them, but for people to believe that the content they read online is organic is dangerous if it&amp;rsquo;s false. When viewed in conjunction with the above article, a few people at a few companies controlling the most used information channels sounds very dystopian, especially since accountability is suspect. Key lesson though? Get your news from multiple sources!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zachholman.com/posts/the-new-10-year-vesting-schedule&#34;&gt;The New 10-Year Vesting Schedule&lt;/a&gt; [zachholman.com] &amp;ndash; A timely and appropriate rant about how the rules around stock options are created such that regular startup employees have the least flexibility and control over how they can retain their hard-earned share in the company, while investors and founders get away with much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sonaligupta2/single-female-disabled-apps-are-saving-me-from-inaccessible?utm_term=.ugdnMXv5W#.vge5kwLAl&#34;&gt;Single With A Disability: Apps Are Saving Me From Awkward Dates And Awful Rishtas&lt;/a&gt; [BuzzFeed] &amp;ndash; A personal account of a woman with muscular dystrophy regarding her experience with dating and arranged marriage in India. Finding an accepting partner can be extremely challenging as a disabled person, and this is a rare story on the topic. I wish it were longer, but good read nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/fashion/modern-love-netflix-relationship.html&#34;&gt;The Entire Netflix History of Us&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; A story of when a couple broke up and their shared Netflix account was the only remaining connection between them. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/column/modern-love&#34;&gt;Modern Love&lt;/a&gt; columns on NYT, because they explore the idea of love at levels and in contexts that are extremely thought-provoking. In many cases, they bring me agonizingly close to feeling painful emotions, but that is probably why I read them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/world/americas/dying-infants-and-no-medicine-inside-venezuelas-failing-hospitals.html&#34;&gt;Dying Infants and No Medicine: Inside Venezuela’s Failing Hospitals&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; I had no idea things were so bad in Venezuela. This article reports a disastrous failure of infrastructure in the country, under political instability and poor economic planning. In particular, hospitals seem to be very badly affected leading to growing mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/2016/5/26/11790878/google-oracle-fight-explained&#34;&gt;Why Google&amp;rsquo;s victory in a copyright fight with Oracle is a big deal&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A short summary of the background between the Google vs. Oracle case that&amp;rsquo;s been all over the news. This includes the current status of the case and legal implications of either party winning. A good start if you know absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:934191705702a94fc45e2007e1bfaf5f&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the good music I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered has been from Coke Studio, thanks to Soundcloud. Tum Naraz Ho is a soothing melody about the time when a person&amp;rsquo;s lover is upset with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168257758&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shakar Wandaan Re is a very energetic composition with catchy and playful lyrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/171491148&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shakar Wandaan Re is also a song from the Pakistani movie called &lt;em&gt;Ho Mann Jahaan&lt;/em&gt;. The movie version is more of a dance number, but still extremely likable and funky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/240416001&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:934191705702a94fc45e2007e1bfaf5f&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blockstack.org/&#34;&gt;Blockstack&lt;/a&gt; is the application stack for building decentralized, blockchain-based applications that don&amp;rsquo;t need any servers to operate. Blockstack applications can be built quickly by plugging into Blockstack&amp;rsquo;s services for identity, naming, storage and authentication. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how this works yet, but is very intriguing and will spend time understanding blockchains. &lt;a href=&#34;https://onename.com/&#34;&gt;Onename&lt;/a&gt; seems to be one such service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://projectinclude.org/&#34;&gt;Project Include&lt;/a&gt; is a cool new initiative by some influential tech ladies to address diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, by creating an opt-in system of accountability for startups. The website also has some nice reading material that I&amp;rsquo;ll gradually make my way through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11650721&#34;&gt;One of my research projects&lt;/a&gt; from my first year of grad school made it to the front page of Hacker News for a while on Saturday. It was unexpected, and probably not a big deal, but was cool since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been there before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bayareadrama.company/the-domestic-crusaders&#34;&gt;The Domestic Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; was a play I watched on Saturday. This was Bay Area Drama Company&amp;rsquo;s version of the original play by Wajahat Ali, focusing on the Muslim immigrant experience in post &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.twitter.com/2016/track-the-pulse-of-the-us-presidential-race&#34;&gt;Track the pulse of the US presidential race&lt;/a&gt; [Twitter Blog] &amp;ndash; Twitter often makes really neat visualizations using tweet data. This one explores &amp;ldquo;how the Twitter buzz about each candidate has shifted week over week since September&amp;rdquo;. Look &lt;a href=&#34;https://interactive.twitter.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid&#34;&gt;Aaminah&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, she often does very intriguing tweetstorms. This month she&amp;rsquo;s done some amazing ones about mental illness. If you&amp;rsquo;ve experienced mental illness, or know someone who has, or just want to be helpful, read these: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/730131499262062592&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/730133438460727296&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/730420676570566656&#34;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/730434924654804992&#34;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to scroll up and wait for all tweets to load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/732313216768843776&#34;&gt;commencement&lt;/a&gt; this month as a Masters student. It was fun, especially since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t attend the one after college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited Colorado this month! For more than two years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve really wanted to go there and never managed to. This time though, I took the initiative before a long weekend and finally did it! I also traveled with friends, something I don&amp;rsquo;t do quite often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyDepressionLooksLike?src=hash&#34;&gt;#MyDepressionLooksLike&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be trending on Twitter for a little while, with people describing their experience of depression. It was strangely reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.getairhelp.com/en/&#34;&gt;AirHelp&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A website that helps you get rightful compensation when your flight is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blog/2176-diversity-and-inclusion-at-github&#34;&gt;Diversity and Inclusion at GitHub&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; GitHub faced public criticism over harassment and poor work culture within the company, but have since worked hard to pull their act together. Good to see such a turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:86be3c0fc21c3bd47d486e80fdc111c8&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/&#34;&gt;Beware Trivial Inconveniences&lt;/a&gt; [LessWrong] &amp;ndash; This is a nice post about how The Great Firewall of China works by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, thereby discouraging casual exploration. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s easy to bypass it with little technical knowledge or instructions, most people don&amp;rsquo;t do it. There are many more situations where it&amp;rsquo;s easy to discourage people from doing certain things simply by making them slightly inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/pornography-industry-economics-tarrant/476580/&#34;&gt;The Hidden Economics of Porn&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; Some very intriguing insights about the porn industy by a gender-studies professor. The porn industry is really BIG, many big-name sites are owned by a single company (MindGeek) and contain pirated content. It&amp;rsquo;s also very interesting to know that porn preferences of people are shaped by the keywords they use, which only reflect some stereotyped categories (that are often sexist, racist, or narrow-minded). Overall, the article contains several questions that ought to be asked about our relationship to porn and our consumption of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@milistjohn/i-am-alex-st-john-s-daughter-and-he-is-wrong-about-women-in-tech-4728545e7c0e#.o0x2dflzr&#34;&gt;I am Alex St. John’s Daughter, and He is Wrong About Women in Tech&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; A fitting reply to the misogynistic and regressive views publicly peddled by Alex St. John, by his own daughter Amilia. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-written response that details her own experiences and why her father&amp;rsquo;s views are misguided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pulitzer prizes were announced at the end of the month, and I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to catch up on a couple of interesting articles that won. I could only do one so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one&#34;&gt;The Really Big One&lt;/a&gt; [The New Yorker] &amp;ndash; This is a great piece of journalism, describing how the Pacific Northwest is due for a MAJOR earthquake. This is not one of your regular doomsday articles &amp;ndash; it goes through a great deal of background (made understandable for the non-expert) and history behind the tectonic activity in the region. It also describes how poorly equipped the region really is to deal with the consequences, and how things will go down if this earthquake hits in the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were other nice articles that came up in my various feeds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/&#34;&gt;Shields Down&lt;/a&gt; [randsinrepose] &amp;ndash; Job resignations don&amp;rsquo;t happen when you decide you&amp;rsquo;re doing it. They happen when a certain event or situation leads you to lower your shields and consider the possibility of an alternative future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/&#34;&gt;Bored People Quit&lt;/a&gt; [randsinrepose] &amp;ndash; A post for engineering managers to detect boredom in their teams, and how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/this-is-hard/the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e#.7ll31ndb5&#34;&gt;The Other Side of Diversity&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; An old article by the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EricaJoy&#34;&gt;Erica Baker&lt;/a&gt; describing her experience with how diversity in the workplace is also about helping marginalized groups build communities for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:86be3c0fc21c3bd47d486e80fdc111c8&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/&#34;&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s a British TV anthology series that features speculative fiction with dark and satirical themes examining modern society, especially wrt the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. I started watching this month, and have liked it a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:86be3c0fc21c3bd47d486e80fdc111c8&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended my first &lt;strong&gt;Anoushka Shankar&lt;/strong&gt; concert this month. Despite not having been a huge fan of her music in the past, I fell in love with the performance and the music. Perhaps my tastes are changing now. Music was from her new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVd3o9OuyxM&amp;amp;list=PLGjLVtehjLeV_z6twUDRKzDkJFhzYbXIV&#34;&gt;Land of Gold album&lt;/a&gt;. Especially look out for the Secret Heart, Land to Nowhere, and Dissolving Boundaries tracks. The album is inspired by the pain and frustration of the recent refugee crisis, and reflects both anger and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Equivalnce&#34;&gt;Abhinav&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to a couple of cool Coke Studio (Season 8) songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Umair Jaswal and Quratulain Balouch are amazing singers, and I particularly adore the flute and violins in this one.

&lt;p&gt;This one is all about Ali Zafar. I always thought he was a good performer, but his vocal range and swagger are stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both the above, the videos are worth watching too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another source of new music was &lt;a href=&#34;http://bolly923fm.com/&#34;&gt;Bolly 92.3 FM&lt;/a&gt;, Bay Area&amp;rsquo;s new Bollywood-only radio channel! I can&amp;rsquo;t describe how glad I am to have this, even though a lot of modern Bollywood music is very forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Zafar again 💜💜💜 alongside Sara Haider, with this rendition of a beautiful song from 1963 sung by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleem_Raza_(Pakistani_singer&#34;&gt;Saleem Raza&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;rsquo;ve been sadder than usual this month, but listening to this song helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/222734241&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been letting Soundcloud just play suggested music in the background, and discovered some interesting stuff as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/97173470&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
James Blunt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Your Beautiful&amp;rdquo; translated to Punjabi, pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/167677079&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
I discovered this acapella version of Strings&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Mera Bichra Yaar&amp;rdquo; two weeks ago, but found it again and really loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far these suggestions have been 👌👏 and I&amp;rsquo;ve just kept the tab open as an anytime go-to radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:86be3c0fc21c3bd47d486e80fdc111c8&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slither.io/&#34;&gt;Slither&lt;/a&gt; is an online multiplayer snake game, with 400-600 players on a board at any point of time. It&amp;rsquo;s wildly addictive, and has been my second-most visited site behind Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.betterthansmalltalk.com/#end-small-talk&#34;&gt;Better Than Small Talk&lt;/a&gt; was an experimental event I attended this month, where the focus was to create an atmosphere that encouraged people to quickly dive into deep conversations. It was interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;ve written more about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/better-than-small-talk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning about online security and encryption, and wrote a couple of blog posts about it (&lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/playing-with-keybase-io&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/signing-git-commits-gpg&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://camlistore.org/&#34;&gt;Camlistore&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; From the website, &amp;ldquo;Camlistore is a set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been worrying about backing up my data for a while, especially with the amount of trust I currently need to have in Google or other third-party tools. I&amp;rsquo;ll be following Camlistore closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gmail.googleblog.com/2016/04/inbox-by-gmail-better-way-to-keep-track.html&#34;&gt;Saving links to Google Inbox&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Google recently announced a Chrome extension for saving links directly into Inbox, and they get bundled too! This is an amazing feature since I did often use Inbox to do the same. &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; has serious competition! This also works on the phone app, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t see bundling there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://modelviewculture.com/&#34;&gt;Model View Culture&lt;/a&gt; and hope to keep in touch with some extremely thought-provoking writings there. It describes itself as a magazine about technology, culture and diversity. Highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Creating a Monthly Log</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/creating-monthly-log/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a backdated post. It was actually published in August, but has been dated appropriately to preserve order of posts. It is a follow-up from my previous attempt to create a weekly log, which turned out to be too much of a commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got a cool idea from &lt;a href=&#34;http://thirld.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Constantin&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. On a more or less monthly basis, he writes about the books, podcasts, and other stuff he reads. I thought that this was great for two reasons &amp;ndash; firstly for keeping track of interesting things which are otherwise too easy to move past and forget, and secondly (for me) building motivation to actually find and engage with more such things, because I get to write about them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So starting now, I will try to write a monthly note on the books, articles, music, movies, websites, observations, and pretty much anything that comes up during that month. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to publish on or around the last day of the month, but there&amp;rsquo;s no pressure to stick to a strict schedule. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first post is &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/monthly-2016-04&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check the entire list &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/monthly-log&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
