      <description>A Kodak film camera is the family&amp;rsquo;s most prized possession. You take it to every trip, but the kids can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted with it. Last time, the 10 year old dropped it and smashed the lens, and you had to get a new one costing thousands of Rupees. Oh family vacation coming up, pack many films because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to run out. Pick ISO 800 film, that&amp;rsquo;s probably safe for all conditions you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring interesting neighborhoods in San Francisco by leisurely walking through them. So far these jaunts have been focused on the Mission and Castro, with the occasional venture into Haight-Ashbury or Hayes Valley. A couple of weeks ago, I visited Dijital Fix, an electronics+design store on Valencia Street. It had some pretty retro electronics and other cool things. I clicked this photo on the way out, and only later realized why I liked it so much.</description>
