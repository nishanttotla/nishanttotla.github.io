      <description>This page is a stub. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a hack meant to publish an archive page using Hugo. The archive page contains a list of all the pages across all sections of the website. To see how it works, check the following files
 themes/skeleton/layouts/partials/archivelist.html &amp;ndash; The main condition here that does the magic is {{ if and (.IsPage) (.Section) (not (eq .Section &amp;quot;archive&amp;quot; )) }} themes/skeleton/layouts/section/archive.html  </description>

      <title>About Acting Class</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to try acting for a really long time, since college in fact. Back then I never managed to get started and it just became one of those bucket list items. While I was preparing for my recent conference talk (April), my co-worker (and co-speaker) Drew suggested that an acting class might really help with public speaking. I love speaking, so when a few days later my friend Vijay asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d like to try something new, I knew what it would be.</description>

      <title>Inside a Floatation Tank</title>

      <description>Today I finally experienced an hour in a floatation tank, also known to some as a sensory isolation tank. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about this for a long time and it is the kind of thing that naturally makes me curious. The basic question is
 How will the brain function when all external stimuli are removed?
 To achieve the conditions for this, you step into a lightless (and I mean &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t-see-your-hands-at-two-inches-away-dark&amp;rdquo;) and soundproof tank filled to a depth of about 10 inches with high concentration Epsom salt solution.</description>

      <description>A Kodak film camera is the family&amp;rsquo;s most prized possession. You take it to every trip, but the kids can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted with it. Last time, the 10 year old dropped it and smashed the lens, and you had to get a new one costing thousands of Rupees. Oh family vacation coming up, pack many films because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to run out. Pick ISO 800 film, that&amp;rsquo;s probably safe for all conditions you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter.</description>

      <description>Articles  The Difference Between Liberalism and Leftism [Current Affairs] &amp;ndash; Simple explanation of the difference between liberalism and leftism (mostly focused on America) that you probably already know about, but the key here is an argument for collaboration between liberals and leftists. Quite often, people from either group refuse to work with those of the other group to steer the progressive movement. While the two might be fundamentally irreconcilable, short term collaboration makes sense.</description>

      <description>Articles  ‘I don’t know who I am without it’: the truth about long-term antidepressant use [The Guardian] &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Prescriptions have doubled in a decade, but very little is known about the effect of taking SSRIs for years and years. Is it a lifesaver or a happiness trap?&amp;rdquo; To be fair, this MUST NOT be taken as a case against antidepressants, which are the difference between life and death for many people.</description>

      <description>A little over two weeks ago, I got my hair colored red. Not completely, just highlights, but very prominent highlights. Nothing unique because millions of people do this sort of thing, so the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing about it is because I can. Kind of the same reason why I colored my hair. It had been on my mind since last year, but the stars started aligning a month ago when a friend referred me to a place in Oakland.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring interesting neighborhoods in San Francisco by leisurely walking through them. So far these jaunts have been focused on the Mission and Castro, with the occasional venture into Haight-Ashbury or Hayes Valley. A couple of weeks ago, I visited Dijital Fix, an electronics+design store on Valencia Street. It had some pretty retro electronics and other cool things. I clicked this photo on the way out, and only later realized why I liked it so much.</description>

      <description>Articles  The Fighter [The New York Times Magazine] &amp;ndash; Pulitzer Prize winning story about US Marine Sam Siatta&amp;rsquo;s traumatic experiences while serving in Afghanistan, and difficulties reintegrating into social life after coming back. It&amp;rsquo;s a long and powerful read.
 When Pixels Collide [sudoscript] &amp;ndash; For April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day this year, Reddit launched an experiment, giving all its users a blank canvas called Place. Each user could place a pixel (out of 16 colors) anywhere on the canvas as many times as they wanted, waiting a few minutes between each time.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a full year of publishing a monthly log! The last time I stuck to something for that long, I got stock options.
Articles  The Trip Treatment [The New Yorker] &amp;ndash; The most comprehensive article I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read about the use of psychedelics for medical treatment (mostly addiction, anxiety, and other mental health conditions). There is renewed enthusiasm in the promise of psychedelic drugs for treatment (this article mostly focuses on psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms), even as they continue to be outlawed, researchers face difficulties getting funding, and several scientific questions remain unanswered.</description>

      <description>Articles  Some Troublesome Questions for Liberals on Borders [Current Affairs] &amp;ndash; As the last few months continue to heavily challenge our belief systems and ideals, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying a lot harder to consolidate my own principles, and what liberalism means for me. Immigration is being talked about a lot these days, and this article raises pertinent questions about the way we argue for it. In summary, we need to do a much better job at constructing more solid (including moral) arguments for immigration, rather than just relying on the economic ones.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader with a short attention span, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to read a lot more books than I currently manage. So I&amp;rsquo;m like the armchair analyst who dreams of changing the world &amp;ndash; tons of ambition, but lack of skills (and possibly desire?). A recurrent problem for me has been that I start some books, partly or nearly finish them, have no interest in continuing, but can&amp;rsquo;t start other books until I finish the earlier ones.</description>

      <description>There are some old posts here, just because I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with the backlog from the last 4-5 months.
Articles  My President was Black [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; A really long (in six parts) and powerful article by Ta-Nehisi Coates on the rise and political career of Barack Obama. It talks about Obama&amp;rsquo;s childhood in Hawaii, the influences that shaped his outlook and policies, and the recent election &amp;ndash; all viewed from the lens of race and history as well.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a word that struck me immediately. I found it on one of those listicles that pull up obscure words that mean very specific things, and then advertize to young adults trying to make sense of their emotions.
 Adronitis
n. frustration with how long it takes to get to know someone—spending the first few weeks chatting in their psychological entryway, with each subsequent conversation like entering a different anteroom, each a little closer to the center of the house—wishing instead that you could start there and work your way out, exchanging your deepest secrets first, before easing into casualness, until you’ve built up enough mystery over the years to ask them where they’re from, and what they do for a living.</description>

      <description>I recently got back to California after spending four full weeks in India. My previous trip was two years ago, at the end of 2014. Until moving to the US in 2012, I&amp;rsquo;d only ever lived in India. Immediately after moving, life in California seemed very attractive, especially by virtue of the things India could not offer (primarily better facilities, a more peaceful lifestyle, and opportunities for individual growth). Whenever I visited India after that, I&amp;rsquo;d often complain about the lack of infrastructure, pollution, poor traffic, general disorder, and a host of other problems that might affect any developing country.</description>

      <description>On December 18, 2016, my parents celebrated the 25th anniversary of Totla Hospital. It has been a long and impressive journey for them, starting out from literally nothing when they arrived in Aurangabad, to having built a very successful and highly respected hospital in the city. To celebrate this anniversary, they had organized a grand function, inviting a lot of former patients, friends, family, and others out of the gigantic community they&amp;rsquo;ve built during this time.</description>

      <description>There are some old posts here, just because I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with the backlog from the last 4-5 months.
Articles  Five Trends Shaping India’s Voting Landscape [Carnegie Endowment] &amp;ndash; Interesting analysis of voting trends and factors affecting elections in India. It touches upon some numbers illustrating patterns around voter turnout, effect of state elections, translation of votes to seats, etc. This was written before the 2014 election though, so some of the analysis might have to be changed as a result.</description>

      <description>Precisely a year ago, I went to Hawaii to try and regain some sanity after what was a terrible 2015. It offered little apart from endless pain, suffering, depression, lack of community, and an uncontrollable feeling of helplessness. So much so that the second half of the Hawaii trip was full of panic attacks and attempts to cut the trip short. I was due to start a new job upon returning, and my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis was still pending.</description>

      <description>Given all the travel and being busy over August to November, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get much time to write or update the monthly log. I&amp;rsquo;m finally able to put something together at the end of November, collecting everything for the last four months in one place. These months have not only been eventful personally, but also politically. The fallout of the election of Donald Trump has affected me a lot, and forced me to read a lot more than I usually do.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to have traveled extensively during the Fall of 2016. A good chunk of that travel was because of work. Back in September, I visited London and St. Louis (Missouri), and attended three different conferences. Later in October, I flew back to Europe, this time to Berlin to attend my fourth conference in two months1. This post focuses on the conferences. I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about the sightseeing I did in future posts.</description>

      <description>Articles  The Day I Got My Green Card [The Wall Street Journal] &amp;ndash; Amidst general gloom and doom, a rare positive story about immigration. Several people (immigrants and citizens) regularly face struggles here, when it comes to issues of inclusion and acceptance in an increasingly polarized world. If you read this though, you&amp;rsquo;ll feel that a lot of luck was still involved in the outcome being positive, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to ignore the immense privilege the author has.</description>

This article is powerful, and has been evoking a lot of outrage over the awful treatment that rape victims are regularly subjected to, and the leniancy of the sentence.</description>

      <description>Articles  Implementers, Solvers, and Finders [rkoutnik.com] &amp;ndash; This article describes three types of roles software engineers can fulfill in a company. Implementers implement solutions handed to them, solvers solve problems handed to them, finders discover those problems. It points out how most engineers only become finders when they choose the management ladder, and how there might still be hope for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to.
 Why people pay to read The New York Times [Medium] &amp;ndash; This is a brilliant point of view, and one that fully aligns with how I think of journalism in the digital age.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to love this quote from Shantaram, a book by Gregory David Roberts.
 But I was alone, and for two reasons: The mafia was theirs, not mine. For them, the organisation always came first. But I was loyal to the men, not the mafia; to the brothers, not the brotherhood. I worked for the mafia, but I didn&#39;t join it. I&#39;m not a joiner. I never found a club or clan or idea that was more important to me than the men and women who believed in it.</description>

      <description>Articles  Beware Trivial Inconveniences [LessWrong] &amp;ndash; This is a nice post about how The Great Firewall of China works by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, thereby discouraging casual exploration. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s easy to bypass it with little technical knowledge or instructions, most people don&amp;rsquo;t do it. There are many more situations where it&amp;rsquo;s easy to discourage people from doing certain things simply by making them slightly inconvenient.</description>

I recently got a cool idea from Constantin&amp;rsquo;s blog. On a more or less monthly basis, he writes about the books, podcasts, and other stuff he reads.</description>

      <title>Signing Git Commits with a GPG Key</title>

      <description>In my last post, I described public key encryption and how you can generate new PGP keys using Keybase. That was just a start, and PGP keys have several uses. One of the first things I wanted to do was to start signing all my Git commits.
Why Sign Commits? Recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above) introduced the ability to sign commits using a GPG key. A signed commit can be verified to make sure that you wrote the code that you claim you did.</description>

      <description>I have to admit, despite having spent so many years studying Computer Science, my understanding of security and modern best practices is pretty shabby. I&amp;rsquo;m fixing that now, and it was a perfect opportunity when a friend invited me to try keybase.io. It&amp;rsquo;s still an Alpha product, and invite-only (or sign up and join the waitlist). I learned new things while trying it out, and wanted to write about it.</description>

      <description>I was talking to my friend Abhay recently, and he brought up a very interesting idea. He works at a software startup that&amp;rsquo;s still relatively small, which means that there&amp;rsquo;s a certain amount of pressure to make quick progress and produce results. This requires having to churn out functioning code on a regular basis. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s often easy to write code by pattern-matching or copying from other sources &amp;ndash; but an entirely different thing to fully understand, and internalize what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>

      <title>So Who Wants to Volunteer?</title>

      <description>In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Yoga class, our instructor wanted to demonstrate a certain asana (pose). She could have easily done it herself, but she wanted a volunteer, perhaps so that she could point out common mistakes people make in this asana. So she asked &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;who wants to volunteer?&amp;rdquo;. As is common in such a situation, most people look around trying to deflect attention. I often do that too, but this time I just raised my hand, albeit a little reluctantly.</description>

      <title>Why I Moved to a Static Website</title>

      <description>As some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained a personal website/blog for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked writing, because I consider it to be a natural extension of thinking. While I&amp;rsquo;m not great with words, I do love keeping track of things I learn &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s really what a blog means to me. Over time, I went through several iterations to find the right platform. Things always revolved around WordPress, and regardless of what I tried, the experience of writing never got much better.</description>

      <description>This post is based on the workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve been employing during my day to day work at Docker. When I first started, I chose to get a 13&amp;rsquo; Macbook Pro, which is a pretty solid machine to own. But a lot of the compiling and testing I needed to do needed a Linux distribution, so I had two options &amp;ndash; install Linux or use a Virtual Machine (VM). Installing VirtualBox and using a simple Ubuntu VM is a fairly straightforward solution, but there were two problems</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to hire a software engineer for a company you work with, and are interested in my background, please read the following to get a sense of what kind of work and culture I value. It would be useful before starting the laborious interview process.
Roles While I&amp;rsquo;m primarily a software engineer, I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily only looking for roles that involve writing code. In the future, I would like to explore career paths that offer alternative kinds of responsibilities, such as management or a mixture of other things.</description>

      <description>I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in one city, with a little occasional travel. I then spent 6 years away from home. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I&amp;rsquo;ve lived since.
In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I&amp;rsquo;d travel to at least one new country each year. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve managed that, but here&amp;rsquo;s a list of all the countries (non-transit) I&amp;rsquo;ve visited so far.</description>

      <description>I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.
In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful.</description>

      <title>2015 Year in Review</title>

      <description>Are you already sick of people writing their yearly review posts? I bet! I’m going to add more more to the pile though, but mostly as a milestone for myself, and for others who might find value in reading it.
To start, I have to say that 2015 has been the most unusual year of my life. I’ve experienced many different things and changed a lot as a person. This is also the year when I finally decided and went through the process of quitting grad school to venture out into the real world.</description>

      <title>Off to Hawaii - a Good End to a Miserable Year</title>

      <description>2015 will go down as the worst year in my life so far, no doubts about that! It has been a year when I suffered a lot, learned some hard lessons, and had to face several uncomfortable truths about myself. I’ve battled terrifying depression and felt things I wasn’t ready to handle. As painful as that has been, I’m glad to be ending the year right – by taking a break from everything, and heading to Hawaii on my first real solo trip.</description>

      <title>India&#39;s Undercurrent of Propaganda</title>

      <description>India is currently at an interesting political standpoint. We finally have a single party forming the central government without needing support from other parties (last this happened was in 1984). The average Indian person seems to be much more aware and concerned about the political situation, and invested in the country’s future, especially young people. All of this is a major shift compared to a few years ago. There have been several contributing factors – dissatisfaction with the UPA govt.</description>

      <title>Learning about Empathy</title>

      <description>Empathy is such a simple concept to understand, yet so difficult to practice! Kids are taught about it. The word itself is lazily thrown around, assuming everyone knows how to empathize, that it’s something we’re naturally good at. Well we’re not! Even if we care enough to look outside our own busy lives to try and want to empathize with someone, it’s too easy to fall into the trap of making judgments or believing we know everything about another person’s situation.</description>

      <description>Sunday, March 28, 2004 : Arsenal vs Manchester United at Highbury, London was the first live football game I watched (on TV, of course). I’d only ever followed cricket before that and played some football, but this was unlike anything I knew in sport. It was fast and full of action. These players were really passionate and the tension was palpable. Then on 50 minutes, Arsenal’s number 14 scored from a brilliant long range effort, a stunning goal by any standard!</description>

      <description>This summer, I was interviewing at several companies. Among other things, it involved a lot of travel, and there was little I could do while traveling. If I was driving, I’d mostly listen to my usual Spotify playlists, although they got boring pretty soon. Taking the train allowed me to read in addition, but I’d usually get distracted or fall asleep since the interviews were exhausting. Soon enough, all this travel time started feeling wasteful, but I wanted to reclaim it, so I constantly tried to find ways to engage in something productive, or learn something new.</description>

      <title>Eight Lessons I Learned in College</title>

      <description>I’m writing a post after around five months! Whoa! What a ride the last semester has been! I’ve now graduated (provided they give me my degree) from one of the best colleges in India, with new hopes and dreams, some knowledge, passion and a lot of friends. The past few months have been a blur, and I’ve done loads of new things. Most importantly, I’ve had the opportunity to think about and look at all that I accomplished (or failed to accomplish) during college, I’ve thought about where my motivations lie, what I want from life and ultimately how I’m going to achieve that.</description>
