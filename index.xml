      <title>Persistent Bash History</title>

      <description>As a software engineer, I spend a lot of time across multiple terminal instances. When I started working at Docker, there were several times when I learned a new way to accomplish something, and then needed to do it again a few weeks later, only to realize I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember the right commands or arguments. Since regular bash history (the history command) isn&amp;rsquo;t very reliable across terminal instances or reboots, I needed a better solution to maintain all history persistently.</description>

      <description>This page is a stub. It&amp;rsquo;s part of a hack meant to publish an archive page using Hugo. The archive page contains a list of all the pages across all sections of the website. To see how it works, check the following files
 themes/skeleton/layouts/partials/archivelist.html &amp;ndash; The main condition here that does the magic is {{ if and (.IsPage) (.Section) (not (eq .Section &amp;quot;archive&amp;quot; )) }} themes/skeleton/layouts/section/archive.html  </description>

      <title>Deciding to Stop</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader with a short attention span, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to read a lot more books than I currently manage. So I&amp;rsquo;m like the armchair analyst who dreams of changing the world &amp;ndash; tons of ambition, but lack of skills (and possibly desire?). A recurrent problem for me has been that I start some books, partly or nearly finish them, have no interest in continuing, but can&amp;rsquo;t start other books until I finish the earlier ones.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a word that struck me immediately. I found it on one of those listicles that pull up obscure words that mean very specific things, and then advertize to young adults trying to make sense of their emotions.
 Adronitis
n. frustration with how long it takes to get to know someone—spending the first few weeks chatting in their psychological entryway, with each subsequent conversation like entering a different anteroom, each a little closer to the center of the house—wishing instead that you could start there and work your way out, exchanging your deepest secrets first, before easing into casualness, until you’ve built up enough mystery over the years to ask them where they’re from, and what they do for a living.</description>

      <title>Signing Git Commits with a GPG Key</title>
      <link>https://nishanttotla.com/scitech/signing-git-commits-gpg/</link>

      <description>In my last post, I described public key encryption and how you can generate new PGP keys using Keybase. That was just a start, and PGP keys have several uses. One of the first things I wanted to do was to start signing all my Git commits.
Why Sign Commits? Recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above) introduced the ability to sign commits using a GPG key. A signed commit can be verified to make sure that you wrote the code that you claim you did.</description>

      <title>Playing with Keybase.io</title>

      <description>I have to admit, despite having spent so many years studying Computer Science, my understanding of security and modern best practices is pretty shabby. I&amp;rsquo;m fixing that now, and it was a perfect opportunity when a friend invited me to try keybase.io. It&amp;rsquo;s still an Alpha product, and invite-only (or sign up and join the waitlist). I learned new things while trying it out, and wanted to write about it.</description>

      <title>Why I Moved to a Static Website</title>
      <link>https://nishanttotla.com/blog/why-i-moved-to-static-website/</link>

      <description>As some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained a personal website/blog for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked writing, because I consider it to be a natural extension of thinking. While I&amp;rsquo;m not great with words, I do love keeping track of things I learn &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s really what a blog means to me. Over time, I went through several iterations to find the right platform. Things always revolved around WordPress, and regardless of what I tried, the experience of writing never got much better.</description>

      <title>Building Code Inside a VM</title>

      <description>This post is based on the workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve been employing during my day to day work at Docker. When I first started, I chose to get a 13&amp;rsquo; Macbook Pro, which is a pretty solid machine to own. But a lot of the compiling and testing I needed to do needed a Linux distribution, so I had two options &amp;ndash; install Linux or use a Virtual Machine (VM). Installing VirtualBox and using a simple Ubuntu VM is a fairly straightforward solution, but there were two problems</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to hire a software engineer for a company you work with, and are interested in my background, please read the following to get a sense of what kind of work and culture I value. It would be useful before starting the laborious interview process.
Roles While I&amp;rsquo;m primarily a software engineer, I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily only looking for roles that involve writing code. In the future, I would like to explore career paths that offer alternative kinds of responsibilities, such as management or a mixture of other things.</description>

      <description>I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in one city, with a little occasional travel. I then spent 6 years away from home. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I lived for five years until moving to San Francisco in 2017.
In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I&amp;rsquo;d travel to at least one new country each year. Barring 2017, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed that so far.</description>
