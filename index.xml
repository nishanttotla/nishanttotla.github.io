      <title>Dear Recruiter</title>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to hire a software engineer for a company you work with, and are interested in my background, please read the following to get a sense of what kind of work and culture I value. If you don&amp;rsquo;t think your company is a good fit, then just don&amp;rsquo;t send me that email, and save both of us some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;roles:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;Roles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m primarily a software engineer, I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily only looking for roles that involve writing code. In the future, I would like to explore career paths that offer alternative kinds of responsibilities, such as management or a mixture of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;rsquo;t work on a technology or area that I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in. I care about solving problems that make people&amp;rsquo;s lives better, or enable them to do better work. Having challenging technology in addition is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also prefer working with engineers who are interested in getting better at what they do, and in helping others do the same. Unfortunately, wanting to be an expert is your area isn&amp;rsquo;t a required quality for software engineers, but I strongly prefer working with such people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;culture:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say the least, company culture matters to me immensely. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but the free beer and happy hours isn&amp;rsquo;t what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. I mean priorities that affect people. Here are some questions for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company encourage transparency? Are all employees seen as valuable members of the team, and encouraged to ask questions and participate? To engage in candid conversation about the company both inside and outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company value diversity in the team at all levels of the hierarchy? Do you make real efforts to make it happen &amp;ndash; not only women but people of color and members of non-privileged classes? I understand if your team doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect this yet, but if you think it means lowering the bar, or it just isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority right now, then our conversation likely ends here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company value learning and personal growth for all employees? I will not work at a company that just wants to &amp;ldquo;get things done&amp;rdquo;. I value environments where my co-workers like to think and learn about things outside their comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company create a respectful and safe environment for everybody to thrive? How are grievances or conflicts addressed? Do people feel like they truly &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo;, or is the founding team a clique full of entitled individuals who feel they&amp;rsquo;re a notch above everyone else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-good:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;All Good?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach out to me via &lt;a title=&#34;Linkedin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishanttotla&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-linkedin&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&#34;Email&#34; href=&#34;mailto:nishanttotla@gmail.com&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-gmail&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No cold calling please, especially on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in the same city, with a little travel. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I&amp;rsquo;ve lived since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I&amp;rsquo;d travel to at least one new country each year. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve managed that, but here&amp;rsquo;s a list of all the countries (non-transit) I&amp;rsquo;ve visited so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mauritius (2004)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Arab Emirates (2004, 2005)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switzerland (2005, 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vietnam (2008)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russia (2009)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kazakhstan (2009)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austria (2010, 2011)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Czech Republic (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy (2010, 2013)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vatican City (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belgium (2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netherlands (2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United States of America (2012)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mexico (2014)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Kingdom (2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cities-visited:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540&#34;&gt;Cities Visited&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to keep track of all cities that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to on a map. This of course doesn&amp;rsquo;t include transit, but only actual cities that I set foot in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zfazlR6PpHXg.kTj-M9kdK9Kg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:1&#34;&gt;I spent the entire summer of 2010 and 2011 living in Klosterneuburg near Vienna.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:2&#34;&gt;I briefly visited in March 2012, before moving in August of the same year.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful. It’s overwhelming to begin with, but everything that’s worthwhile has to start somewhere! This is obviously not a complete list, but hopefully the union of content within all entries on the list will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-papers:dc4816fae14320f2f4f74f4d0f551d32&#34;&gt;Research Papers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>2015 Year in Review</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/2015-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2015 19:16:02 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/2015-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Are you already sick of people writing their yearly review posts? I bet! I’m going to add more more to the pile though, but mostly as a milestone for myself, and for others who might find value in reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I have to say that 2015 has been the most unusual year of my life. I’ve experienced many different things and changed a lot as a person. This is also the year when I finally decided and went through the process of quitting grad school to venture out into the real world. I’ll try to keep it short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;depression-and-personal-growth:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Depression and Personal Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started in late 2014 as a series of depressive episodes turned into a full-blown depression that lasted for most of 2015. It affected nearly every area of my life, most notably my ability to work. Research suffered and I failed to make any meaningful progress, which in turn only made it harder to recover. My ability to make friends, and keep in touch with existing ones also took a hit as I became increasingly lonely. It took a lot of time to accept this and start taking steps to get better, and I’m still on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it has been a very troubling period where I came in touch with some of the darkest emotions in me, it has also been full of trememdous learning about self and personal growth. It taught me to take a hard look at my priorities. It showed me which people are really well-wishers and were willing to help when I needed it most. I realized the value of community and investing in relationships, something I’d never thought important because I believed I could survive on my own. It also made me a lot more empathetic to the suffering of other people, and I think I emerge from it a better person. Probably more cynical, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;world-view:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;World View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a consequence of my struggles, I became much more attuned to the struggles of other people, in particular underprivileged groups. I realized that the world isn’t always a fair place, and is heavily biased in favor of those already predisposed to success. Causes like equality (gender, race etc.) gained new meaning for me, and my opinions of right and wrong evolved to a large extent. I also started participating in discussions and voicing opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I was ever as productive in grad school as I would like, but 2015 turned out to be the tipping point. Things got to a stage where my lack of progress had become a chronic problem and nothing I was trying seemed to work. Changing research groups didn’t seem quite possible then, so leaving grad school completely was the only plausible option. It took me a while to come to terms with the decision, but it became clearer as time passed. I had some great interviews and got several job offers which was good for my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/docker&#34;&gt;@docker&lt;/a&gt; later this year! Super excited, looking forward to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aluzzardi&#34;&gt;@aluzzardi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vieux&#34;&gt;@vieux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abronan&#34;&gt;@abronan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sam_alba&#34;&gt;@sam_alba&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/647555264699219968&#34;&gt;September 25, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the battle was only half won, and consistent efforts to gain back my lost productivity have finally bore some fruit, and I feel confident I can do great things with my new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel wise, 2015 was a decent year. I managed to stick to my resolution of visiting at least one new country each year. This year, it was an amazing summer trip to the UK (England+Scotland), and a (just concluded) winter trip to Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Goodbye Hawaii, it&amp;#39;s been a meaningful trip! Time to go back to normal life and start afresh. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NzS1Pnftk4&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NzS1Pnftk4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Traveler Boy (@nrt_travel) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nrt_travel/status/682771096320409602&#34;&gt;January 1, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few other short trips too, but not nearly enough! The overwhelming guilt that comes from not being productive is a big enemy of travel, and I’ve been trying hard to control it. Still, I’m proud and happy for the travel I managed to do, but looking forward to all the more that I will do in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped running long distances after the hip injury I had in late 2014, hoping to get to its root before starting again. I picked up biking instead and started riding long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having learned my lesson from running, I built up mileage too much too soon, and ended up with an overuse injury to the back that would keep me out for much of the year. What finally did put me in touch with my body was picking up Yoga, which not only showed me how ill-prepared I was to go through extreme physical stresses, but also gave me a framework to think about how to treat my body and be gentle with it. Most importantly, to listen to my body. Mental stress also contributed most likely, and is as much part of overall recovery as anything else. I hope to take these learnings into the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-2016:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;In 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my work is laid out clearly. I need to rediscover my productivity by performing well at work, while simultaneously giving more importance to community both in my personal and professional lives. I will travel more. I will recover from my injuries and respect my body. I will remember to apply everything I’ve learned the hard way this year to similar problems. Life isn’t going to be any easier, but I will be wiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I write this post next year, I hope there will be more positivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Off to Hawaii - a Good End to a Miserable Year</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/off-to-hawaii/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2015 15:39:26 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/off-to-hawaii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2015 will go down as the worst year in my life so far, no doubts about that! It has been a year when I suffered a lot, learned some hard lessons, and had to face several uncomfortable truths about myself. I’ve battled terrifying depression and felt things I wasn’t ready to handle. As painful as that has been, I’m glad to be ending the year right – by taking a break from everything, and heading to Hawaii on my first real solo trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Booked tickets to Hawaii today, leaving in 5 days!! 🙌🙌🙌 Now gotta figure the rest out. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/678304771921436672&#34;&gt;December 19, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m leaving tomorrow, for 8 days, and relishing the opportunity to relax, contemplate, and plan for the coming year. I’m going to spend a few days in Honolulu, and the rest living on an organic farm not far from some hills. I plan to run, hike, eat, read, and swim at the beach. I’ll do what I want, go where I like. There will be plenty of time to write too, and prepare for my new job which I start soon after returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully intend to cut down social media use during the stay, and concentrate on the moment. The stress and poor lifestyle during 2015 have diminished my focus and severely affected my ability to think deeply about hard problems. I want to start recovering some of that. For starters, I have a book to read, along with some exciting new research papers. Hoping to have a great trip!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India&#39;s Undercurrent of Propaganda</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/india-undercurrent-propaganda/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 16:01:47 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/india-undercurrent-propaganda/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India is currently at an interesting political standpoint. We finally have a single party forming the central government without needing support from other parties (last this happened was in 1984). The average Indian person seems to be much more aware and concerned about the political situation, and invested in the country’s future, especially young people. All of this is a major shift compared to a few years ago. There have been several contributing factors – dissatisfaction with the UPA govt., anti-corruption activism by AAP, strong leadership in the BJP to name a few. Optimism has been brewing for a while and people are looking forward to progress. Whether the current political setup will deliver on all promises remains to be seen, but as the collective euphoria fades, there’s a different kind of problem surfacing in the country now. It’s difficult to describe precisely, but it includes a deepening chasm between different groups of people, lack of constructive criticism and the ability to handle it, and a seeming absence of nuanced public discourse. Of course, these are my opinions, but the explosion of Indians’ social media presence has made it easy to quickly process a lot of diverse opinions to try and make sense of what people really think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, religious intolerance is a hot topic right now after &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/indian-mob-kills-man-cow-slaughter-rumour-150930193719666.html&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34504434&#34;&gt;unsavory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/11/indian-scholars-return-awards-demand-free-speech-151102101213399.html&#34;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; over the last few weeks. This has led several people to express concern, while many others think of these events as outliers. Going further, some believe in a full fledged international conspiracy to bring the country down. It doesn’t help that opposing political parties readily exploit the situation, the news media is downright sensationalist and often insensitive, and the ruling party remains selectively silent. I will NOT try to pick sides in these debates, because that is futile and painful&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e27ad0a7be6c3af4d3da2b23560dabef:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e27ad0a7be6c3af4d3da2b23560dabef:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What I do want to talk about is how bigoted propaganda is proliferating in the country right now, aided both by easier access to technology and people’s unwillingness to see eye to eye on complex issues that don’t have straightforward answers. As a result, the answers aren’t coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it’s an undercurrent is because it is largely based on viral sharing of propagandist messages across social media and messaging platforms. It consists of hate speech, wrongly attributed quotes, and fabrication of facts to emotionally manipulate people who don’t know what to believe, or will not put in effort to verify what they’re reading. Some central themes keep coming up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India is a Hindu country, and Hindus must have their wishes respected at any cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ruling party (and prime minister) are mostly faultless and doing great work, while some anti-national elements are trying to ruin it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India’s intellectuals are complicit with those who are conspiring against the country, and are &amp;ldquo;minority-sympathizers&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18vfcg/who_does_sickular_refer_to_isnt_secularism_a/&#34;&gt;sickulars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muslims are responsible for a lot of India’s problems (social and economic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All those who can’t handle Hindu nationalism should go to Pakistan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no religious intolerance in the country, and anyone who speaks up against the government or Hindus deserves retaliation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on, and these are all complex points, given how strongly they’re being voiced now. It’s true that people are pretty tired of weak and corrupt governments from the past, and have pinned a lot of hopes on the current one, so it’s natural to be defensive and find other avenues to pin blame. Politics in the country has always been heavily influenced by religion, but maybe this is the first time a prime minister has strongly advertised himself as an ardent Hindu, while also convincing people he can lead the country’s development. The prime minister’s strong persona and lack of leadership among other parties was a prime reason for the overwhelming majority during elections, but the ruling party is a large and eclectic one – in terms of ideology and methods. And even though the prime minister doesn’t endorse any violence or hatred, his silence and &lt;a href=&#34;http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/bjp-leader-vijayvargiya-attacks-shah-rukh-khan-says-his-soul-in-pakistan/&#34;&gt;occasional  hateful statements by fringe party members&lt;/a&gt; are seen as endorsement by fanatics who want to push their own agendas. All this might not be an issue given India has a large Hindu majority anyway – except India is a much more complicated country. Even at 80% Hindu, we still have more than 270 million people who don’t identify as Hindu. For context, this is comparable to the population of the entire United States (~320 million). If we’re going to keep building up propaganda that alienates such a large number of people, it could possibly divide society irreparably, because none of these people are going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding what public figures say, how are common citizens actually forming opinions? After all, public opinion can hold huge sway in a democracy, and it’s really important that people get their facts right. This is my biggest beef with this whole undercurrent of propaganda – pure BS spreading around virally. As mobile phones and internet access spread quickly, exposing many people to the internet for the first time, we can expect that what they will be fed a lot of new ideas. If seasoned internet users sometimes can’t tell what’s true online, I fear that new users are especially prone to believing everything they read. Especially content that is articulate and sounds legitimate. Consider this WhatsApp message that’s been going around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a translation, click &lt;a href=&#34;https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Translations-for-propaganda-messages-forwarded-in-India-Fk3IGFAI5WiDA2aSOH9m5&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great example of a message that sounds so harmless at first, but eventually subtly tries to pass off a positive correlation between not killing cows and a country’s progress. There’s no such correlation obviously, and Uruguay doesn’t hang people if they kill a cow. On the contrary, Uruguay is a leading exporter of premium quality beef, often lauded for its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30210749&#34;&gt;advanced practices&lt;/a&gt;. See how this further fuels the controversy around beef, in a country where &lt;a href=&#34;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryana-makes-sale-of-beef-a-non-bailable-offence/articleshow/46590961.cms&#34;&gt;it’s already a storm&lt;/a&gt;? As if it doesn’t matter that Uruguay has an entirely different economy, size, and social structure. This might seem like a trivial example, but innocuous things like these can end up being influential in shaping people’s ideas. Just consider the following tweet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The writer of the Moody&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;warning&amp;quot; to Modi is the son in law of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AwardWapsi?src=hash&#34;&gt;#AwardWapsi&lt;/a&gt; Irfan Habib?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; rati parker (@ratigirl) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ratigirl/status/660336942186409984&#34;&gt;October 31, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a question, and (surprise surprise!) the answer is NO. But the tweet went viral anyway and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newslaundry.com/2015/11/05/how-the-irfan-habib-son-in-law-rumour-made-its-way-from-twitter-to-prime-time-news/&#34;&gt;people bought it, it was news&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that this isn’t a one-off thing, it happens all the time, and can consolidate opinions based on absolutely false information. It’s a sad state of affairs when people just won’t bother checking facts, and comfortably use (or worse, fabricate) anything that suits their cause. Because when it comes to public discourse, rhetoric rules and facts are for losers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that this is exclusively India’s problem. Most countries in the world have their own internal clashes and propaganda, and suffer because of it. What IS India’s problem though, is people interested in fueling an atmosphere of hatred and misunderstandings, even though the current government has opportunities and the support to undo several past grievances. This problem includes trolls and haters who spread misinformation, normal people who spread it further without bothering to verify it, the media that likes to &lt;a href=&#34;http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/salman-khan-on-the-intolerance-issue-my-mother-is-susheela-charak-father-is-salim-khan/&#34;&gt;put people on the spot to extract juicy quotes&lt;/a&gt;, politicians who keep making regressive statements, and also intellectuals who often try to ignore the problem and stay away, instead of trying to educate those who are missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another issue that I consider unique to India (as far as I’m aware) is sharing propaganda via private messaging services such as WhatsApp. These have exploded in popularity over the last few years. Communities and groups on these services are also ripe grounds for spreading misinformation – but with an additional downer – there is no liability or a way to verify anything. For instance, who knows where the message about Uruguay above came from, how many people read or questioned it. There is no way to know, nor can you call someone out for manufacturing information (like you can with tweets or Facebook posts). What’s commonly shared here are messages that paint a one-sided picture, reinforcing whatever people believe or want to believe. People’s social circles are often largely composed of other people with similar views, and there is little opportunity to see the broader context, or have healthy debates. This leads to them saying things like “I don’t see any religious intolerance around me, it’s all fake” etc. This also makes it easy for them to generalize their views about other groups of people. Here’s another example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.github.io/images/propaganda-post/msg2.png&#34; style=&#34;width:50%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&#34;https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Translations-for-propaganda-messages-forwarded-in-India-Fk3IGFAI5WiDA2aSOH9m5#:h=Message-2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a translation. Notice how this message makes tall claims, and signs off as the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office). It’s not hard to craft messages like these, and there are several people who believe that this is actually coming from the PMO. That can’t be right at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that I’m nitpicking. And I really hope so, because after having seen how fake stories and propaganda blew up the debate against vaccines&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e27ad0a7be6c3af4d3da2b23560dabef:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e27ad0a7be6c3af4d3da2b23560dabef:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or still bogs down progress on climate change, I’m paranoid about how easy it is to create fear among unsuspecting people. The cold war was a grand spectacle of exactly this. Fear is a strong emotion, and can easily lead entire societies to make irrational or emotional decisions that halt progress or prove costly over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, some of the points raised in some other forwarded messages are legitimate questions to ask, but are often buried under loads of generalization and lies. It’s hard to separate the two, and the audience is often gullible. Most people will probably not react to such propaganda, but there are always those who will use these to justify criminal activities. And we’re not even starting to talk about prejudice and subliminal bias. Whether or not you agree with everything I’ve written, the next time you get any sort of message or read something that is leveling accusations or blaming someone, be extra careful, verify facts (Google is your friend!), try to critically analyze and discuss with someone, and only then consider passing it on. It’s easy to hit that forward button, but you never know who you’re sending messages to. You might be very calm and nice yourself, but maybe your recipients aren’t, so be mindful of that and make sure you think twice, especially if you’re in an influential position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not proposing any solutions or suggesting I have answers, but it’s probably worthwhile to introspect the small actions we perform on a daily basis, because sometimes it’s not a few very bad people who bring the group down, but a large number of “slightly bad” people who are okay with the occasional wrong action. We’ve seen our apathy lead to problems before, let’s not have hatred create more. I can’t tell you what to believe in, because I don’t know the solutions, but I’m pretty sure that hateful propaganda isn’t going to benefit anyone. The reality for a large country like India is very complex, and &lt;strong&gt;EVERYTHING YOU READ ON THE INTERNET IS NOT TRUE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e27ad0a7be6c3af4d3da2b23560dabef:1&#34;&gt;Besides, I don’t live in India currently, and have to accept that I might not have the full picture.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e27ad0a7be6c3af4d3da2b23560dabef:2&#34;&gt;I still can’t believe that became a thing!

      <title>Learning about Empathy</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/learning-about-empathy/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2015 15:46:09 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/learning-about-empathy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Empathy is such a simple concept to understand, yet so difficult to practice! Kids are taught about it. The word itself is lazily thrown around, assuming everyone knows how to empathize, that it’s something we’re naturally good at. Well we’re not! Even if we care enough to look outside our own busy lives to try and want to empathize with someone, it’s too easy to fall into the trap of making judgments or believing we know everything about another person’s situation. Empathy is especially tough because it requires us to not only understand a different person, but also to set aside our own biases and keep an open mind, all of which are notoriously difficult things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having gone through a rough patch involving several personal struggles over the last two years, and distinctly feeling that nobody understood my situation, I’ve realized an important lesson. Empathy is defined as “the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person”, and that is really the key – &lt;strong&gt;understanding feelings&lt;/strong&gt; – as opposed to just understanding the problem at hand or trying to find a solution. The best way to do it is simpler than you can imagine, you just have to ask! Think about it, how many people have asked you in the last few days how you feel? Have you asked anyone? We all struggle with the stresses of modern life, but rarely ask each other how we feel. To add to it, we immediately make up our minds about others, and this only blocks out further communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering to focus on how someone is feeling rather than what they’re talking about, or how they’re behaving, helps me better understand and help people. This is especially valuable while dealing with conflicts – someone might be upset at you but if you understood how they felt, your opinion and even reaction might change. If a friend berated you for being late, you might be upset because she’s being too touchy. But if you knew that she lost her job that day and is feeling down, not only are you likely to let it go, but might also alter your behavior and try to make her feel better instead of getting upset yourself. For someone like me who usually tends to get upset quickly, this is a VERY useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who empathize with others are more likable and less likely to pick up extended conflicts. I believe lack of empathy is a prime ingredient in a lot of the hatred and stereotyping that is perpetrated today. Everyone conveniently judges others from their own safe points of view. I’m guilty too, but have been trying hard to correct it. While empathy is not the solution to every problem in the world, it can certainly alleviate some!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the only takeaway from this post is to always keep your mind open for what the other person is feeling. If you can’t figure it out, remember to ask! People can be pleasantly surprised when you do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supporting a Football Club</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/supporting-a-football-club/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 19:10:35 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/supporting-a-football-club/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3553027.stm&#34;&gt;Sunday, March 28, 2004 : Arsenal vs Manchester United at Highbury, London&lt;/a&gt; was the first live football game I watched (on TV, of course). I’d only ever followed cricket before that and played some football, but this was unlike anything I knew in sport. It was fast and full of action. These players were really passionate and the tension was palpable. Then on 50 minutes, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWhCegHpQJc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=257&#34;&gt;Arsenal’s number 14 scored&lt;/a&gt; from a brilliant long range effort, a stunning goal by any standard! The game ended at 1-1, but Arsenal were beautiful to watch. They counter-attacked with breathtaking speed, defended like a rock, and had brilliant individuals. I would go on to watch a few more Arsenal games that season. When I visited Mauritius the following summer and saw a banner proclaiming “Arsenal – Champions 2003-04”, the club’s global reach made an impression on me – I had made my choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support Arsenal Football Club. I watch their games, follow their activities, feel happy when they win, disappointed when they don’t. But why all this long-term affection for a team that’s based thousands of miles away, in a city I’ve never lived in? Why spend so much time and energy worrying about what is “just a game after all”? In short, what does it mean to support a club?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The football season, to be honest is pretty much the same affair every year. Each team will play every other team twice – home and away in the league, and there may be two or three cup competitions. It might look painfully monotonous to an outsider. To quote from the movie Fever Pitch&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:77fce4fd1418c0509b702f30679a8dd6:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:77fce4fd1418c0509b702f30679a8dd6:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;custom-quote&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h1 class=&#34;icon-quote-left&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anthropologists have always had a hard time with Football. The trouble is, you can only see what’s on the outside, but there IS an inside, believe it or not. We all have our reasons for loving things the way we do.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside for me is that it’s not about the season, year after year. It’s about having something to look forward to in a normal week. I can have a disastrous week, yet, I will tune into the weekend game with unsullied fresh hope, hoping for a victory. And when it happens, I temporarily forget all there is to worry about, and rejoice. Each week presents a new challenge, and this is what keeps fans going on. The flip side is that a bad day for the team can make it worse for you. But then, that’s a gamble we’re all willing to take. Football fans often believe that the fortunes of their favorite team are invariably linked to their own. The team doing well coincides with life moving uphill, and the team doing badly means life sucks. I’ve experienced that, and it honestly is irrational and crazy. Yet it’s a very comforting and hopeful feeling, one that I don’t want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One’s relationship with the football club evolves over time. I think there are three broad stages – What, How and Why. At the start (the What), it is greedy, you want results from your team. You want to have bragging rights. If you manage to stay in it long enough, things change, and you come into the How of it. You gradually start taking more interest in the team’s affairs. You start being worried about how individuals combine to actually make the team work. How is it that the team plays as it does? How does the coach contribute? When this happens, you’ve crossed a certain threshold. After this, it will be hard to start following a new team. Finally, the Why of it. This is the part when you have surpassed your purely on-the-field relationship with the team, and you see it as something more. You know the history. You know club legends, and you have finally accepted the team as a part of your life. The team influences you, and you feel your support makes a difference, however small. It is an obsession of some sort, but then this is what Hornby says about it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;custom-quote&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h1 class=&#34;icon-quote-left&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why is it that adults aren’t supposed to go mad about anything? You’ve got to keep a lid on it, and if you don’t, then people are apparently entitled to say what they like. You haven’t grown up, you’re a moron. Your conversation is trivial and boorish, you can’t express your emotional needs. You can’t relate to your children, and you die, lonely and miserable. But you know, what the hell?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, there are certainly social aspects of football, being the one true global sport that it is. If you want one example of absolutely diverse people coming together, forgetting their differences and cheering for the same thing, then you need to look no further. I’ve bonded with people just because we support the same team. This makes it worthwhile, and fosters a lot of positivity around the world&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:77fce4fd1418c0509b702f30679a8dd6:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:77fce4fd1418c0509b702f30679a8dd6:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Quoting from The Fever Pitch again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;custom-quote&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h1 class=&#34;icon-quote-left&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not easy to become a football fan. It takes years. But if you put in the hours, you’re welcomed without question into a new family. Except in this family, you care about the same people and hope for the same things. What’s childish about that?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But teams aren’t constant entities, they change. What happens if an important player leaves your club and joins another team? Many people do not buy the idea of supporting a club. Of course, players will rarely keep playing for one club their entire careers, but supporting a club is different from rooting for your favorite player. It is an involvement with the entire philosophy, style and ideas of the organization as a whole. A single player can be important, but never bigger than the club. Supporting the club is about feeling connected with its history, being bothered with its present, and hoping for a successful future. Players will come and go, but a club stays on. You pin hopes on a player, feel sad or angry when he leaves, but you move on. How is that very different from life anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to why I started supporting Arsenal, it was the way they played – slick movement and ruthlessly effective – qualities I hugely admired. Those were also Arsenal’s glory years, when they won trophies and were feared. I was a defiant young person and it was a match made in heaven. I watched every game expecting a win, and that was a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, a lot changed, including the club’s fortunes. Arsenal went from being the best in the country to a good team that famously stopped winning trophies, until only recently. All those years were about hope and belief. It was the time when I grew as a person, and learned that things weren’t always good or easy, that disappointments were real. Arsenal frustrated me, but also let me enjoy moments of pure joy. I’m not the same person I was a decade ago, but my support for this team has stayed all along. I’ve grown with it, and it feels like an integral part of the things I believe in. Does that sound ridiculous? Maybe, but I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenal aren’t your average club. It’s one of the few that value their history and try to stick to their philosophy and style of play. A club that has persistently shown class and maintained standards. A big factor in this is the current manager, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger&#34;&gt;Arsène Wenger&lt;/a&gt;, and the way he has kept the team competitive despite financial constraints and immense pressure. Make no mistake, the modern football manager’s job is both glamorous and risky, several get fired in a season for underperforming. Yet Arsenal are one of the rare clubs that have stuck with the manager for more than 19 years now. He hasn’t seen as much success as I think he deserves, but he has provided stability and nurtured some great talent in a climate where clubs are often left with two choices – pile on more debt, or lose their edge (and players). None of that for Arsenal, who have successfully built a new stadium and are now gradually getting back to being the best. Despite &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WengerOut&amp;amp;src=typd&#34;&gt;frequent vocal opposition against him&lt;/a&gt;, he has set a great example, so much that for many fans (including me), he’s a major part of the club’s current identity (his first name helps too I guess!). He’s a man who breathes football, protects his players, believes in maintaining standards, is passionate not just about his job, but the club too. Of course he won’t be around forever, but what he has achieved here will be hard to emulate. If football clubs are built in the image of people associated with them, then Arsenal is the club I’d want to support without doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success is only one part of the equation. It’s true that Arsenal have never recaptured the glory of 2004, are no longer title contenders by default, constantly written off by the media. But that doesn’t affect me anymore. My bond to this team is different now. It still looks the same on the outside, but has been tempered by many strong feelings over the years. Trophies were an expectation before, but now they’re just a response to those that write us off. Winning against the odds is totally different from winning when you’re favorites. Winning isn’t always important, because this team has made me see failure, defiance, and ultimate success. A few years ago, I maintained a safe and objective distance, like the single-minded love of the new fan. Today, it’s about memories and moments that swept me off my feet. I no longer wave my allegiance around in people’s faces, nor do I expect others to adore the team. It’s just a constant source of joy, like a successful long-term relationship with its highs and lows, but never doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to intermittent memorable moments, football abounds in them. Going back to May 26, 1989, when Michael Thomas scored in the last 10 seconds, the goal that won Arsenal the championship, you can see the drama and emotion that I’m talking about&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rediscovering Podcasts</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/rediscovering-podcasts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2015 15:50:52 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/rediscovering-podcasts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I was interviewing at several companies. Among other things, it involved a lot of travel, and there was little I could do while traveling. If I was driving, I’d mostly listen to my usual Spotify playlists, although they got boring pretty soon. Taking the train allowed me to read in addition, but I’d usually get distracted or fall asleep since the interviews were exhausting. Soon enough, all this travel time started feeling wasteful, but I wanted to reclaim it, so I constantly tried to find ways to engage in something productive, or learn something new. Then one day I was reading an article in which CEOs of some companies described how they made their commutes productive. One of the ideas was to listen to audiobooks. I didn’t have any books in mind, but I immediately remembered how I’d once wanted to try podcasts, and never did. I downloaded an &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;Android app&lt;/a&gt; and loaded some interesting podcasts. I quickly realized that this was what I was looking for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I only recently discovered how nice it is to listen to podcasts while driving. It&amp;#39;s educative + makes me feel less lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/634283994704535552&#34;&gt;August 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with listening to some podcasts about people sharing their experiences, and soon moved on to human behavior and social skills. I also tried some economics, culture, and science. I found podcasts refreshing for several reasons. First of all, I was listening to very stimulating and engaging content, which excited me and kept me alert. This was especially welcome during long lonely drives, often in rush hour traffic. Second, podcasts often featured people having a conversation, where I would laugh and grimace and feel actively involved. Most importantly though, I learned a great deal about diverse topics, and this is something I love to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just going to emphasize that podcasts are brilliant and unrivaled when you want to productively use time when only your auditory senses are free. This is their biggest advantage compared to all other information media, especially seeing how everyone is constantly “engaged” these days. Podcasts are a regular fixture for drives now, and I’m gradually trying to add them to other tasks like cooking, cleaning, and in general anything that doesn’t require immense concentration. Of course, there are still times when I just want silence, or music, but in general, I’m a big fan of trying to find opportunities to learn small bits that could eventually add up to major life changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eight Lessons I Learned in College</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.github.io/blog/x-lessons-i-learned-in-college/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2012 19:26:42 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing a post after around five months! Whoa! What a ride the last semester has been! I’ve now graduated (provided they give me my degree) from one of the best colleges in India, with new hopes and dreams, some knowledge, passion and a lot of friends. The past few months have been a blur, and I’ve done loads of new things. Most importantly, I’ve had the opportunity to think about and look at all that I accomplished (or failed to accomplish) during college, I’ve thought about where my motivations lie, what I want from life and ultimately how I’m going to achieve that. And in this post, I’m going to try and summarize all that. I entered this place as a high-on-success and low-on-wisdom defiant individual. I now leave as a mature and responsible, motivated and slightly wiser person. So here are some of the most important lessons I would want to pass on after having survived the jungle that undergraduate life is&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-be-liberal:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be Liberal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you asked me for the single most important lesson college life taught me, then it would without doubt be the ability to take a liberal stand on any issue (moral, philosophical or legal) that may or may not affect me directly. When I came in as a freshman&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I must admit I was as dumb as one can get. I had strong ideas – they were strong not because I had seen the world and come to well thought-of conclusions. My ideas were just a product of my upbringing, the popular media (mostly Indian), and the conversations with self that one usually has when they’ve been sitting alone in a room for hours. So what happened during college? Surely, not all those ideas changed. What changed was my approach to them, what I thought of my convictions, how I defended them and how I urged others to see my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I used to be vegetarian in first year, and still am, but unlike then, I no more think that eating meat is “wrong”. I have realized that all my opinions are results of my thoughts, and no more right than yours. Contrary to what a lot of people think, being liberal for me is not about trying my hand at everything – yes you can be liberal and a vegetarian, a teetotaler, and staunchly religious all at the same time. By being liberal, I mean the ability to take into account everyone else’s point of view, all the data available, and then consciously and justifiably form opinions. It incorporates the basic premise that no opinion is sacred, and as long as people are happy with their choices and lives, you have no right, or reason to meddle. This is the simple secret to leading uncomplicated lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-think-independently-and-explore-recklessly:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Think independently and explore recklessly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly feel that we have stopped thinking. As a student community, there seems to be less emphasis on independent thought and charting out our own course. Most of us (and I’m no less guilty) just try to follow the golden path laid down before us. It’s either that high-paying job, or the highly ranked university somewhere in the USA. While there’s nothing wrong with these choices, what’s wrong is making these choices just because they are the in-thing. Do we ever stop to think what our motivation in life is? We all need to ask this question to ourselves sooner or later – do we really plan to do something with lasting value, something different? Are we willing to take risks, do something our peers aren’t doing? College may or may not be sufficient for us to find our life’s calling, but just the realization that one needs to do what they love the most, is important. It might seem trivial to think about, but if you look around, people easily forget this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent thought comes out of knowing a lot of things, which is in turn borne out of having explored a lot of avenues. You like watching that sport? Try playing it. You like music? Try your hand at learning how to play your favourite tune. Learn how to write code. Learn a new language. Explore how it is to work in a company. Dabble your hands in research. Explore other fields of work, try to figure out the arts. Don’t waste your time sitting upon things you already have. You will never have the kind of freedom you can afford in college, so don’t let it be wasted on nothing. Learn to get your hands dirty, learn to make yourself curious, who knows you might find diamonds in the dirt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-lose-some-inhibitions:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Lose some inhibitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a few friends who’ve been living frightened lives – inside a cocoon of their own making, one that keeps them far away from things they’re scared of. I was no different when I started, and unfortunately, I believe I wasted a couple of years sticking to myself, until I found friends who would pull me out of my shell. I’ve realized that college is the first (and probably the last) time when you have the opportunity to overcome your fears, to make an effort to challenge yourself on the personal front. Have you ever tried singing in front of few dozen unknown people? Have you ever taken part in a debate and publicly made a fool of yourself? Are you afraid of wearing shorts in public lest you show your sexy (or ugly) legs? Are you enraged if your beliefs are questioned? If yes, then are you doing something about it? Shouldn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why all this trouble? It is because quite a few of the qualities developed this way surely help later in life, directly or indirectly. And you would never know you had those qualities, unless you loosened up and dirtied your hands with a few scary-looking activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m not saying that you should try everything just for the heck of it, but it does make a lot of sense to put yourself in situations you have no idea how to handle yourself in. This teaches you one very important life lesson, which is that of standing up to unexpected scenarios and deal with new kinds of emotions. Isn’t this what life is about anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-interact-with-the-opposite-sex:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Interact with the opposite sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a society as prudish as ours, this is always a tricky issue. More so in an environment like IITB, with a highly polarized sex-ratio. Firstly, why is this important? From what I know, males and females often have differences in their points of view, perhaps due to different upbringing. Understanding this is important. Life will eventually make you interact with people of the opposite sex. You will have colleagues, a spouse, friends. You will want to know what they find offensive or how open to certain ideas you can expect them to be etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a male point of view, I’ve seen some guys becoming excessively abusive, and outright disrespectful towards the females they see daily. Blame this on a testosterone-intense environment if you will, but unless you’ve been friends with a girl, you might tend to develop sexist attitudes, or be uncomfortable in one-on-one interactions. And this will surely cause problems at some point, on a personal level or more. Learn to look at boy-girl communication in an uncomplicated way. Encouraging and taking part in healthy interactions with the opposite sex are a certain step towards creating a healthy society based on mutual respect. The same applies to girls, while interacting with males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So meet people of the opposite sex. Make friends with them, learn about their ideas, opinions and constraints. Don’t worry about being close to someone. These exchanges go a long way in making you comfortable in any group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-procrastination-will-take-you-down:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Procrastination will take you down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrastination can be a bane for anyone, even the most brilliant mind out there. Truth be told, it can’t be avoided. We all do it, and probably need it in healthy amounts. But when it gets out of control, it threatens to take over and leave you irritated and frustrated with a feeling of zero-accomplishment in the end. I’ve learned this the hard way. For most of my college life, I’ve procrastinated like any outrageously shameless and careless procrastinator you’ll see out there. On days when I ought to have worked, I spent my time doing stuff like finding patterns in the genres of the songs in my iPod, or adding every movie I’ve watched to my IMDb account. Not bad things to do, but when a deadline is looming, not the kind of stuff one should get into. An hour before final exams, I’ve gotten bouts of compulsively playing Minesweeper, or of just lying down and day dreaming. Yes life seems to have passed very peacefully, but all the procrastination didn’t do me much good. When I was supposed to work, I wasted time, and when I ought to have partied, I was suddenly hit by the stark realization that I hadn’t worked at all, and I could not party. Now that’s a bad situation, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning my lesson, and trying to correct this habit. This isn’t uncommon among college students, but I have the feeling that unless you’re super sharp, and can earn your living based on momentary strokes of brilliance, you can’t afford to procrastinate too much. There’s no substitute to hard work and putting in the hours. In other words, if you’re a reasonably smart and motivated person, then motivation is the biggest gift you have. It’s a gift that is easily lost, so make it (and your time) count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;6-make-friends-with-all-kinds-of-people:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Make friends with all kinds of people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close friendships formed in college are special. They are probably more mature than the ones you form in school, which usually weather down with time and physical distance. A college student is more mature, and the connections that form here are based on mutual interests or similarity in points of view. These tend to last longer. Meeting a friend from college is a sure shot way to reminisce “good old days” when you had the time of your lives. Having friends teaches you various things – it opens you up to new points of view, teaches you how to compromise, how to be part of a motley and still enjoy yourself. Friends support you when you’re down, share your joy when you’re happy, and empty your purse when you accomplish. Friends fool around with you, discuss with you – from gossip to philosophy. Friends introduce you to new experiences, help you lose inhibition, motivate you to follow your heart – be it love or work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a wonderful group of friends who’ve done all the above to me, and I owe a major chunk of my development to them. A few years down the line, I won’t remember the grades I managed to score, what will be remembered are moments that shaped me as a person, and those moments will invariably have been spent with friends. You need memories to live life by, and memories are even better with people in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, also make friends with some professors that you like. They might not fool around with you, but will be of great help and mentor you when it comes to choosing your career. There’s no substitute to having great mentors. Additionally, a lot of wisdom can be gained from friendly professors – wisdom which is often quirky, amusing and might apply to you directly. Also make friends with people in the administrative divisions, so that you can break free of the red tape and get your work done faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;7-get-along-with-people-who-are-better-than-you:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Get along with people who are better than you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how much of a superstar you were before getting into college, you would do well to realize as quickly as possible – that in almost any conceivable activity, there will be someone better than you. In a college like IITB, with so many talented and diverse people, a very essential lesson I learned was that of humility. Whatever high opinions of myself I might have had when I joined were shattered when I realized that there were people who could do a lot of things I was very bad at, or I couldn’t do at all. And I benefited very much from having such an amazing peer group around me. By learning from people who did things better than me, I either got better myself, or realized where I was going wrong. Respecting others for what they’re worth is an important trait for dealing with people, and is also a quality learned simultaneously with humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;8-keep-your-health-in-check:9b58b0368b70bddebc221d8554995d35&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Keep your health in check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re planning to become a gym instructor after college, or get into a job that requires basic physical fitness, you’re going to regret not exercising in college. Most of us are careless individuals, we eat whatever is served to us, we don’t care to lose the calories, we ignore the slight paunch or the double chin. We think that just a little exercise can put us back in shape. The truth is that the more you postpone it, the harder it will be to regain fitness. It is easy to be lazy, but everyone should get into some sort of activity. Once you get out of college, exercising regularly is going to be real hard so it is essential to build up great fitness during college. If you bloat up during college, then god save you afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so that’s about it. Of course, there are many more things I learned, but these stand out as the essential points that I really wanted someone to tell me much earlier. In any case, I’m spending this summer feeling nostalgic about the past four years. Whether or not you learn something, the memories last really long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this website primarily to record and share my thoughts and ideas. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer by profession, but I have a wide variety of other interests. Some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently include company culture, common stereotypes, and social justice (check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.github.io/earth-tones-talk/#/&#34;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; I gave at a recent people of color meetup).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.github.io/images/cinderella_half.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:30%; float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid black;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider adventure to be a big part of my identity &amp;ndash; not only the thrill-seeking kind, but also what allows me to lead a life of exploration and moving away from convention. Some of this appetite is satisfied by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/athletes/2749248&#34;&gt;long-distance running and biking&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.github.io/places&#34;&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt;. One of my long term goals is to attain enough financial independence to lead a life that primarily involves adventure in some capacity. At that point, I&amp;rsquo;ll gladly give up my current one that involves hours looking at a computer screen every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, I enjoy playing music, reading, learning about new science and technology, and thinking about personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

The design is based on top of the excellent work by &lt;a href=&#34;http://prakhar.me&#34;&gt;Prakhar Srivastav&lt;/a&gt; using the minimalistic CSS framework called &lt;a href=&#34;http://getskeleton.com&#34;&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icons on the site are courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://fontello.com/&#34;&gt;Fontello&lt;/a&gt;. Typography uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro&#34;&gt;Source Serif Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway&#34;&gt;Raleway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
