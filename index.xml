&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:93bd3d21ade43b2e539b8b0da913a60b&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/06/the-difference-between-liberalism-and-leftism&#34;&gt;The Difference Between Liberalism and Leftism&lt;/a&gt; [Current Affairs] &amp;ndash; Simple explanation of the difference between liberalism and leftism (mostly focused on America) that you probably already know about, but the key here is an argument for collaboration between liberals and leftists. Quite often, people from either group refuse to work with those of the other group to steer the progressive movement. While the two might be fundamentally irreconcilable, short term collaboration makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/technology/tech-billionaires-education-zuckerberg-facebook-hastings.html&#34;&gt;The Silicon Valley Billionaires Remaking America’s Schools&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; Silicon Valley billionaires are using their money and reach to directly introduce (opinionated) technology and impact how things work at many of America&amp;rsquo;s public schools. All of this with little oversight and understanding of the long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2017/06/silicon-valley-still-doesnt-care-work-life-balance/&#34;&gt;The Gospel of Hard Work, According to Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; [Wired] &amp;ndash; This is not the first article to talk about the unhealthy workaholic culture in Silicon Valley (and it won&amp;rsquo;t be the last). Also related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.signalvnoise.com/trickle-down-workaholism-in-startups-a90ceac76426&#34;&gt;Trickle-down workaholism in startups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jezebel.com/how-dadaji-became-a-feminist-1796147906&#34;&gt;How Dadaji Became a Feminist&lt;/a&gt; [Jezebel] &amp;ndash; Interesting story about the (Indian) author&amp;rsquo;s grandfather, who was and continues to be uncharacteristically progressive for his generation. While it seems like Indians continue down the path of more racism and misogyny, stories like these are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@SycamoreRed/on-cultural-appropriation-f6a5bb1a92d0&#34;&gt;On Cultural Appropriation&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; A good explanation of cultural appropriation for skeptics. It also talks about what differentiates cultural appropriation from cultural exchange. I suggest reading with an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/style/modern-love-to-stay-in-love-sign-on-the-dotted-line-36-questions.html&#34;&gt;To Stay in Love, Sign on the Dotted Line&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; A good column that resonated with me. Romantic relationships are contractual in nature, with a lot of implicit expectations and assumptions baked in. This couple tried to make them more formal and explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thebolditalic.com/you-are-now-fully-optimized-716f482b17f5&#34;&gt;You Are Now Fully Optimized&lt;/a&gt; [The Bold Italic] &amp;ndash; Good ol&amp;rsquo; satire making fun of excessive use of technology never stops being fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts:93bd3d21ade43b2e539b8b0da913a60b&#34;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout June, Hidden Brain started to explore how cultural stereotypes and biases take shape, and how they affect everything from social behavior to the actions of police to the justice system. These four podcasts are highly recommended in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/2017/05/29/530192364/how-a-theory-of-crime-and-policing-was-born-and-went-terribly-wrong&#34;&gt;Broken Windows&lt;/a&gt; [Hidden Brain] &amp;ndash; The &amp;ldquo;broken windows&amp;rdquo; theory of policing suggested that cleaning up the visible signs of disorder &amp;ndash; like graffiti, loitering, panhandling, and prostitution — would prevent more serious crime. This was credited with reducing crime in New York City in the 90s, until cracks began to appear in the apparent effectiveness of the theory, particularly in the way it affected minority communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/2017/06/05/531578107/the-thumbprint-of-the-culture-implicit-bias-and-police-shootings&#34;&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Thumbprint Of The Culture&amp;rsquo;: Implicit Bias And Police Shootings&lt;/a&gt; [Hidden Brain] &amp;ndash; This episode explores research about implicit bias and how a culture of racism can infect us all. It talks about the famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html&#34;&gt;Implicit Association Tests&lt;/a&gt; that have had limited impact on an individual level, but turns out that applying the test results at a societal level can give us meaningful predictors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/2017/06/12/532633692/rap-on-trial-how-an-aspiring-musicians-words-led-to-prison-time&#34;&gt;Rap on Trial: How An Aspiring Musician&amp;rsquo;s Words Led To Prison Time&lt;/a&gt; [Hidden Brain] &amp;ndash; Are rap lyrics that are considered violent treated more unfairly in courts, than country music lyrics that are equally violent? This episode tries to answer this question while following the story of one Olutosin Oduwole who was charged for an unusual crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/2017/06/19/532963059/when-is-it-terrorism-how-the-media-covers-attacks-by-muslim-perpetrators&#34;&gt;Is He Muslim?&lt;/a&gt; [Hidden Brain] &amp;ndash; Despite the widespread conservative opinion that mainstream media does not cover acts of terrorism by Muslims enough, turns out that they receive a disproportionately high amount of coverage, especially when compared to similar acts by other groups of people. This episode explores what such coverage does to the psyche of people watching it, and how to counter some of the deleterious effects of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:93bd3d21ade43b2e539b8b0da913a60b&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acadia National Park &amp;ndash; I spent two days in Acadia National Park, combining it with the trip to Boston. It was beautiful, and an unusual park because of the intermingling between public and private land. Also my first time in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City &amp;ndash; I finally spent some real time in New York City! It was a &amp;ldquo;work vacation&amp;rdquo;, but I explored satisfyingly enough, and also watched several shows. Some of the highlights included watching Kevin Spacey, Trevor Noah, and Stephen Colbert in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:93bd3d21ade43b2e539b8b0da913a60b&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F89eycANUrQ&#34;&gt;How I learned to read &amp;ndash; and trade stocks &amp;ndash; in prison | Curtis &amp;ldquo;Wall Street&amp;rdquo; Carroll&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; The video summary says &amp;ldquo;Financial literacy isn&amp;rsquo;t a skill &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a lifestyle. Take it from Curtis &amp;ldquo;Wall Street&amp;rdquo; Carroll. As an incarcerated individual, Caroll knows the power of a dollar. While in prison, he taught himself how to read and trade stocks, and now he shares a simple, powerful message: we all need to be more savvy with our money.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a short and inspiring TED talk, I recommend watching whenever you have a few minutes to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/future/gallery/20170619-inside-indias-humungous-solar-plant&#34;&gt;Inside India’s humongous solar plant&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Some interesting photos and videos from Kamuthi in Tamil Nadu, one of the world’s largest solar power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/06/dont-know-who-am-antidepressant-long-term-use&#34;&gt;‘I don’t know who I am without it’: the truth about long-term antidepressant use&lt;/a&gt; [The Guardian] &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Prescriptions have doubled in a decade, but very little is known about the effect of taking SSRIs for years and years. Is it a lifesaver or a happiness trap?&amp;rdquo; To be fair, this MUST NOT be taken as a case against antidepressants, which are the difference between life and death for many people. What is worth though, is having a better understanding about cases where SSRIs can genuinely help (which I have seen IRL) and those where they just cause side-effects with little relief (which I have also seen IRL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thebaffler.com/salvos/hamilton-hustle-stoller&#34;&gt;The Hamilton Hustle&lt;/a&gt; [The Baffler] &amp;ndash; I watched Hamilton, the musical this month. It&amp;rsquo;s a terrific work of art, and worth watching at least once if you can make it. That said, I never went in expecting to see an accurate representation of history. Turns out that this is not the case for many people, and as I later learned, Alexander Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s legacy is debated by several scholars. This isn&amp;rsquo;t very personal for me, and I&amp;rsquo;ve looked for opinions critiquing the representation of Hamilton in the musical. This article is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/the-stubborn-persistence-of-confederate-monuments/479751/&#34;&gt;The Stubborn Persistence of Confederate Monuments&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; Based on a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, some 1500 artefacts dedicated to Confederate legacy still exist in the US. This article briefly describes the history of some of the more notable ones, and argues why taking monuments down is not tantamount to &amp;ldquo;erasing history&amp;rdquo;. Also related is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/opinion/white-supremacist-confederate-monuments-nazi.html&#34;&gt;this NYT article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/sunday/why-the-future-is-always-on-your-mind.html&#34;&gt;We Aren’t Built to Live in the Moment&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; Quoting &amp;ldquo;Our emotions are less reactions to the present than guides to future behavior. Therapists are exploring new ways to treat depression now that they see it as primarily not because of past traumas and present stresses but because of skewed visions of what lies ahead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150720.Proof&#34;&gt;Proof&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Well technically a play by David Auburn, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama back in 2001. We had to read it for acting class, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to perform a scene from it on the final day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arts:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Arts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve significantly cut down on watching movies and TV, as I spend more time indulging in performing arts and theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamilton Musical (San Francisco) &amp;ndash; Hamilton is the rage these days, and they&amp;rsquo;re on tour in San Francisco. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask how I obtained tickets or how much I had to pay, but I will admit that it was right up there among the best performances I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on stage. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monsoon Wedding Musical (Berkeley) &amp;ndash; I loved the Monsoon Wedding movie when I watched it a few years ago. Some of the more serious themes (not giving any spoilers away) particularly stuck with me, and I obviously wanted to go see it when the musical debut was announced at the Berkeley Repertory Theater! What&amp;rsquo;s more, it is directed by Mira Nair herself, and I was lucky to have tickets to opening night. I enjoyed it overall, especially individual performances, and even got to meet the actors (and Mira Nair!) after. While I thought that the overall thing still needed more polish (maybe I was unfairly comparing with Hamilton in my mind), I was happy nonetheless, particularly because I got to learn more about the acting careers of some of the actors. This is something I&amp;rsquo;m increasingly interested in, given my own interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5707802/&#34;&gt;Dear White People&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I kind-of binge watched the TV show that&amp;rsquo;s being talked about a lot. It was interesting because it talks about a lot of the modern American social themes around racism, sexism, etc. while also depicting the underlying conflicts that shape individuals who participate in activism around these issues. I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that the movie (of the same name) is better, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to watch that too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks, Utah &amp;ndash; Third new state in as many months! It had been a while since I saw remarkably beautiful landscapes like these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masala Coffee&amp;rsquo;s Malayalam rendition of the Tamil song Kaanthaa is an earworm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:5327781aeee4632627d872ffd455a9bb&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my acting class nears an end, I decided to sign up for the Intermediate Acting class that will take place at the Berkeley Repertory Theater over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other personal updates, I now have bright red hair, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikitribune.com/&#34;&gt;WikiTribune&lt;/a&gt; is a new kind of news platform that is trying to recreate how news works. Through transparent funding and allowing common citizens to report news that is verified and fact-checked by professional journalists, it tries to bridge the gap between the proliferation of false news and the more traditional journalism done by media houses. I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see how this works out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Red Hairing</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/red-hairing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 13:32:52 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/red-hairing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little over two weeks ago, I got my hair colored red. Not completely, just highlights, but
very prominent highlights. Nothing unique because millions of people do this sort
of thing, so the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing about it is because I can.
Kind of the same reason &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I colored my hair.
It had been on my mind since last year, but the stars started aligning a month ago when
a friend referred me to a place in Oakland. After a brief consultation with Megan&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:f8033754994359e6d66edbf4cd616350:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:f8033754994359e6d66edbf4cd616350:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I
narrowed down on the style and colors (it was between red and blue). A week later, I
went ahead and did it, picking ruby red on the day of. I shared every step of the process
on my Instagram account, but deliberately left out the final result, so I could see
reactions first-hand! Enough people have seen it now, so I can finally share a photo and
some of the reactions. (I kept track, hah!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/red-hairing.JPG&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;📸 credit: Vasuki&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what people have told me so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From general compliments or questions&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Looks great”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think it would look so good on you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Red suits you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What motivated you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;to extreme surprise (that was my dad)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“बेटा ये क्या कर लिया?!” (Son, what have you done?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and smartass quips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That&amp;rsquo;s a cherry on top”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi Weasley”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and some comments that were certainly not complimentary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t mind, but you look like a lorry driver from India”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone’s looking at you on the street”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;to the best one (coming from the lead actress of the Monsoon Wedding musical, on opening night)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I saw your hair from the stage! I was looking down and thinking this dude has red hair!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst of the lot though probably was when someone didn&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge the change,
because honestly it&amp;rsquo;s a form of expression and one of the best ways to express
yourself is through your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:f8033754994359e6d66edbf4cd616350:1&#34;&gt;Megan is a hair-stylist at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.futurevanitynovelty.com/&#34;&gt;Future&lt;/a&gt; in Oakland. Go there and she&amp;rsquo;ll take good care of you.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:f8033754994359e6d66edbf4cd616350:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Black Mirror</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/black-mirror/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2017 23:03:38 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/black-mirror/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring interesting neighborhoods in San Francisco by leisurely
walking through them. So far these jaunts have been focused on the Mission and Castro,
with the occasional venture into Haight-Ashbury or Hayes Valley. A couple of weeks
ago, I visited &lt;a href=&#34;https://dijitalfix.com/&#34;&gt;Dijital Fix&lt;/a&gt;, an electronics+design store on
Valencia Street. It had some pretty retro electronics and other cool things. I clicked
this photo on the way out, and only later realized why I liked it so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/black-mirror.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:70%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to call it &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, for more than one reason. It literally is a black
colored mirror to begin with, so nothing special there. But for those familiar with
the TV show of the same name that is &amp;ldquo;centred around dark and satirical themes that
examine modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of
new technologies&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:42b346f3c66eb29c697d52cbcfeda0b3:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:42b346f3c66eb29c697d52cbcfeda0b3:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s more. As I hold up the phone to get a selfie, I&amp;rsquo;m putting
myself up for the world to see. But for the world, it&amp;rsquo;s like watching a broadcast &amp;ndash;
relevant one moment, forgotten the next. It&amp;rsquo;s life and meaning for me, but a fleeting
moment for those flipping channels. On one of them, I&amp;rsquo;m On Air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:dde9150f2b3ddea1502663ef2dbfeb9f&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/magazine/afghanistan-soldier-ptsd-the-fighter.html&#34;&gt;The Fighter&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times Magazine] &amp;ndash; Pulitzer Prize winning story about US Marine Sam Siatta&amp;rsquo;s traumatic experiences while serving in Afghanistan, and difficulties reintegrating into social life after coming back. It&amp;rsquo;s a long and powerful read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/&#34;&gt;When Pixels Collide&lt;/a&gt; [sudoscript] &amp;ndash; For April Fool&amp;rsquo;s Day this year, Reddit launched an experiment, giving all its users a blank canvas called Place. Each user could place a pixel (out of 16 colors) anywhere on the canvas as many times as they wanted, waiting a few minutes between each time. This article delves into the fascinating patterns that showed up while the experiment ran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history&#34;&gt;The forgotten history of how automakers invented the crime of &amp;ldquo;jaywalking&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; [Vox] &amp;ndash; TL;DR: Lobbying runs America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nplusonemag.com/issue-28/politics/the-syria-catastrophe-2/&#34;&gt;The Syria Catastrophe&lt;/a&gt; [n+1 Magazine] &amp;ndash; A long and comprehensive look (one of many out there) at the crisis in Syria, with the added emphasis that everyone needs to first agree that &amp;ldquo;anti-war&amp;rdquo; is the way to go if we&amp;rsquo;re going to stop the humanitarian crisis. This is particularly relevant because most entities in the war have agendas that are built upon blaming other entities.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:dde9150f2b3ddea1502663ef2dbfeb9f:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:dde9150f2b3ddea1502663ef2dbfeb9f:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/style/modern-love-the-physics-of-forbidden-love.html&#34;&gt;The Physics of Forbidden Love&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the Modern Love column on NYT. While I never include these columns in my monthly logs, I chose to break that rule because of the several fronts on which this story struck a chord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:dde9150f2b3ddea1502663ef2dbfeb9f&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin, Texas &amp;ndash; I spent a week in Austin, traveling for a conference where I also gave a technical talk for an audience of several hundred people. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to explore too much of the city, but whatever little I did, I was surprised by how much I liked it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:dde9150f2b3ddea1502663ef2dbfeb9f&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;More &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaikkudam_Bridge&#34;&gt;Thaikkudam Bridge&lt;/a&gt; after last month. A bluesy version of the popular &amp;ldquo;Inteha&amp;rdquo; song.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amit Trivedi is one of the best musicians in Bollywood right now. He performed some of his best compositions with a group of artists at the Royal Stag Mirchi Music Awards. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice video to watch if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:dde9150f2b3ddea1502663ef2dbfeb9f&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://greatist.com/grow/resources-when-you-can-not-afford-therapy&#34;&gt;81 Awesome Mental Health Resources When You Can’t Afford a Therapist&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Access to therapy, and especially good therapy is hard. This is a good list of resources (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t vetted the entire list and certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t tried most of the options), and worth sharing just in case it helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usafacts.org/&#34;&gt;USA Facts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://datausa.io&#34;&gt;Data USA&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; These are separate collaborative efforts to help search for and visualize data related to critical aspects of America such as health, education, jobs, etc. Try them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined a beginner acting class at the Berkeley Repertory Theater. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to be finally doing this after wanting to try acting for years!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a full year of publishing a monthly log! The last time I stuck to something for that long, I got stock options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:5c182ffb7987962fd8c85c8697c88234&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/09/trip-treatment&#34;&gt;The Trip Treatment&lt;/a&gt; [The New Yorker] &amp;ndash; The most comprehensive article I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read about the use of psychedelics for medical treatment (mostly addiction, anxiety, and other mental health conditions). There is renewed enthusiasm in the promise of psychedelic drugs for treatment (this article mostly focuses on psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms), even as they continue to be outlawed, researchers face difficulties getting funding, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. The article also delves into the history of origins and usage of psychedelic compounds, as well as the major figures and research labs currently leading the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/upshot/what-if-sociologists-had-as-much-influence-as-economists.html&#34;&gt;What if Sociologists Had as Much Influence as Economists?&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; For most policy decisions, economists are the go-to experts today. And yet, several economic policies fail to take into account sociological factors that cannot be reliably modeled by market dynamics. Here&amp;rsquo;s an opinion on why it makes sense to increase involvement of sociologists in policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mars-needs-lawyers/&#34;&gt;Mars Needs Lawyers&lt;/a&gt; [FiveThirtyEight] &amp;ndash; A take on the legal issues that are going to come up as more countries foray into space, and major space expeditions continue to be more collaborative in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/essays/if-plastic-replaces-cash-much-that-is-good-will-be-lost&#34;&gt;In praise of cash&lt;/a&gt; [Aeon] &amp;ndash; In light of India&amp;rsquo;s recent focus on demonetization, and the common preference for &amp;ldquo;cashless&amp;rdquo; transactions in several industrialized countries, here&amp;rsquo;s one article arguing why cashless isn&amp;rsquo;t the utopia it&amp;rsquo;s advertized to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/&#34;&gt;Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; Quoting &amp;ldquo;Tech companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve conditions for female employees. Here’s why not much has changed—and what might actually work.&amp;rdquo; This is a really long read, and summarizes recent progress and possible future steps to make Silicon Valley a more welcoming place for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/08/what_happens_when_sexual_assault_happens_on_a_long_haul_flight.html&#34;&gt;Flight Risk&lt;/a&gt; [Slate] &amp;ndash; As the discussion on sexual harassment and assault gets more attention, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile considering which settings are poorly equipped to handle instances of it (the answer is almost all settings). This article discusses what happens when sexual assault takes place on a flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citylab.com/work/2017/03/the-economic-power-of-global-cities-compared-to-nations/519294/&#34;&gt;The Economic Power of Cities Compared to Nations&lt;/a&gt; [CityLab] &amp;ndash; Quoting from the article, &amp;ldquo;Tokyo, the world’s largest metro economy with $1.6 trillion in GDP-PPP, is just slightly smaller than all of South Korea. Were it a nation, Tokyo would rank as the 15th largest economy in the world.&amp;rdquo; There are more such comparisons in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/8974435/switzerland-work-life-balance&#34;&gt;Living in Switzerland ruined me for America and its lousy work culture&lt;/a&gt; [Vox] &amp;ndash; Of all the industrialized nations, America often gets the most flak for poor labor laws, unhealthy work culture, and insufficient benefits. This post describes one family&amp;rsquo;s experience in Switzerland, and how much better life can be there compared to America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/why-dentistry-is-separated-from-medicine/518979/&#34;&gt;Why Dentistry Is Separate From Medicine&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; A take on the history of why dentistry in America is so separate from the rest of healthcare. It discusses how dentistry evolved in the country, and what prevents it from being merged with mainstream healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts:5c182ffb7987962fd8c85c8697c88234&#34;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to several podcasts during the last few months, and they should be included in monthly logs. Here are some of the good ones from March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/29/521950337/episode-650-the-genius-behind-get-out&#34;&gt;Episode 650: The Business Genius Behind Get Out&lt;/a&gt; [Planet Money] &amp;ndash; An intriguing movie production company called Blumhouse (behind the recent hit &amp;ldquo;Get Out&amp;rdquo;), whose business model is to produce a large number of low-budget movies, and bet on the success of a few. The most notable example is Paranormal Activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/22/521132960/episode-760-tax-hero&#34;&gt;Episode 760: Tax Hero&lt;/a&gt; [Planet Money] &amp;ndash; Why taxes continue to be difficult to file in America, and a look at a dedicated individual&amp;rsquo;s failed attempt to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/15/520294083/episode-522-the-invention-of-the-economy&#34;&gt;Episode 522: The Invention Of &amp;lsquo;The Economy&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; [Planet Money] &amp;ndash; How the GDP came to be the single metric of a country&amp;rsquo;s progress (it&amp;rsquo;s a very recent idea!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:5c182ffb7987962fd8c85c8697c88234&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/&#34;&gt;Denial&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Based on a true story, this movie is about writer and historian Deborah Lipstadt, who gets sued for libel by a Holocaust denier, and the court case rests on proving that the Holocaust actually occurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:5c182ffb7987962fd8c85c8697c88234&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana &amp;ndash; My first visit to the famous city, and also first time in the South.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:5c182ffb7987962fd8c85c8697c88234&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Funk version of the iconic Humma song by Benny Dayal is quite good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/0XfMrkS3Jfk&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaikkudam_Bridge&#34;&gt;Thaikkudam Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is a Kerala-based music band, and they have some brilliant covers. This is an interesting twist on Beat It (Michael Jackson).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/epAJ3VKbU_U&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:5c182ffb7987962fd8c85c8697c88234&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sidewaysdictionary.com/#/&#34;&gt;Sideways Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; This is a collection of analogies that try to explain (in simple terms) technical terms related to security. Analogies are crowdsourced, and people can vote on which ones they like. The Washington Post will integrate Sideways Dictionary into all of its stories. Any security keywords appearing in an article will be linked to the dictionary. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2017/03/sideways-dictionary-google-washington-post/&#34;&gt;Wired article&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/annie-easley-computer-scientist-and-mathematician&#34;&gt;Annie Easley, Computer Scientist and Mathematician (photo)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; In 1955, Annie Easley began her career at NASA, then the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), as a human computer performing complex mathematical calculations. See the photo to understand its significance. The NASA image feature page is generally cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/index-of-best-ai-machine-learning-resources-71ba0c73e34d#.xtlbxjgda&#34;&gt;Index of Best AI/Machine Learning Resources&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A large collection, saving for future use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/about&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; An open-source Twitter competitor, the advertising says. The idea isn&amp;rsquo;t new in my book, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this implementation turns out. It looks promising, going by initial reception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:ba0e22dee794a25c4a033332b484e270&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/10/some-troublesome-questions-for-liberals-on-borders&#34;&gt;Some Troublesome Questions for Liberals on Borders&lt;/a&gt; [Current Affairs] &amp;ndash; As the last few months continue to heavily challenge our belief systems and ideals, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying a lot harder to consolidate my own principles, and what liberalism means for me. Immigration is being talked about a lot these days, and this article raises pertinent questions about the way we argue for it. In summary, we need to do a much better job at constructing more solid (including moral) arguments for immigration, rather than just relying on the economic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2017/02/russians-engineer-brilliant-slot-machine-cheat-casinos-no-fix/&#34;&gt;Russians Engineer a Brilliant Slot Machine Cheat &amp;ndash; And Casinos Have No Fix&lt;/a&gt; [Wired] &amp;ndash; A Russian company found a way to reverse-engineer the pseudo-random number generator algorithms of some casinos, and managed to win much more than slot machines usually give. This is the story of how they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.t5eiitm.org/2017/02/chronicle-imprisonment-foretold/&#34;&gt;A Chronicle Of An Imprisonment Foretold&lt;/a&gt; [The Fifth Estate][TW: sexual harassment] &amp;ndash; A story of sexual harassment on the IIT Madras campus. It highlights the victim&amp;rsquo;s personal experience and the ineffectiveness of systems designed to deal with cases like these. Looking back to my time at IIT Bombay, none of this comes across as a great surprise, and I can only begin to imagine the plight of students who silently suffer harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/parliaments-around-the-world-what-can-architecture-can-teach-us-about-democracy/&#34;&gt;Parliaments around the world: what can architecture teach us about democracy?&lt;/a&gt; [Hansard Society] &amp;ndash; This very intriguing article takes a look at how Parliaments are structured in countries around the world. The idea is to try and understand how political culture is shaped by architecture and also expressed through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/02/the-magical-rationalism-of-elon-musk-and-the-prophets-of-ai.html&#34;&gt;The Magical Rationalism of Elon Musk and the Prophets of AI&lt;/a&gt; [NYMag] &amp;ndash; Are those who worry about how AI will make humans irrelevant just doomsday prophets, using the power of &amp;ldquo;magical rationalism&amp;rdquo; to make the risks appear legitimate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html&#34;&gt;Announcing the first SHA1 collision&lt;/a&gt; [Google Security Blog] &amp;ndash; The Google Security team announced the first SHA-1 collision. The computation they required for it is massive, but still accessible by today&amp;rsquo;s standards, which means it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time all systems using SHA-1 need to move away from it. Also check &lt;a href=&#34;http://shattered.io/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information. This announcement was possibly overshadowed by &amp;ldquo;Cloudbleed&amp;rdquo;, the Cloudflare bug that was revealed on the same day. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read the analysis, so that&amp;rsquo;ll probably make it into the next month&amp;rsquo;s log.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/&#34;&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; The little-told and uplifting story of the role of black women at NASA during the 50s and 60s. As the US competed with the Soviet Union in the space race, several black women played key roles in enabling the first manned space flight and the moon mission, destroying barriers and stereotypes along the way. This is interesting particularly in contrast with the Civil Rights movement, which was at its peak during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/&#34;&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I binged through Season 2 of this gripping alternative history series, which imagines what the world might have looked like had the Allies lost WWII. Highly recommended for history buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to more of Zeb Bangash lately, and find this song quite beautiful. This song also reminds me of Spring, and makes me feel quite optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/&#34;&gt;Where are the Voyagers?&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A NASA JPL link that tracks the live location of the two Voyager spacecrafts. Both are interstellar spacecraft, and have been a source of fascination for me since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

While their message seems agreeable (I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually seen the video itself), there are legitimate issues around providing a platform and voice to a rapist on this subject, points which this article aptly raises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Deciding to Stop</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/deciding-to-stop/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader with a short attention span, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to read a lot more books
than I currently manage. So I&amp;rsquo;m like the armchair analyst who dreams of changing the
world &amp;ndash; tons of ambition, but lack of skills (and possibly desire?). A recurrent
problem for me has been that I start some books, partly or nearly finish them, have
no interest in continuing, but can&amp;rsquo;t start other books until I finish the earlier ones.
Obviously there&amp;rsquo;s merit to sticking it out, but more often than not, time could be better
spent reading books out of which I could derive most value, rather than struggle with ones
that are neither adding much value nor getting done (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19438058-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance&#34;&gt;Robert Pirsig&lt;/a&gt;). What I&amp;rsquo;m suggesting isn&amp;rsquo;t
groundbreaking, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember &amp;ndash; the guilt and pressure of finishing
a book is a strong deterrent to moving on and reading more books that you can actually
finish. The same applies to TV shows, jobs, relationships (but we won&amp;rsquo;t go there).
It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to simply view all of this as the sunk cost fallacy, but stating out
the special case is always useful. That&amp;rsquo;s why we have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2014/jul/07/hawking-index-give-up-on-books-capital-fifty-shades&#34;&gt;Hawking Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There are some old posts here, just because I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with the backlog
from the last 4-5 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:522ff2422ef90d5eff638eb49e6ceed5&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793&#34;&gt;My President was Black&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; A really long (in six parts) and powerful article by Ta-Nehisi Coates on the rise and political career of Barack Obama. It talks about Obama&amp;rsquo;s childhood in Hawaii, the influences that shaped his outlook and policies, and the recent election &amp;ndash; all viewed from the lens of race and history as well. If there&amp;rsquo;s one long article you read this month, let this be it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://niskanencenter.org/blog/defense-liberty-cant-without-identity-politics&#34;&gt;The Defense of Liberty can&amp;rsquo;t do without Identity Politics&lt;/a&gt; [Niskanen Center] &amp;ndash; Identity politics has been recently maligned as one of the major causes of general dissatisfaction with the government. This is a solid essay that explains in good terms why Trump&amp;rsquo;s election is no reason to get rid of identity politics. In fact, we need more of it to make sure the rights of oppressed groups are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@Bahujan_Power/pioneering-a-survey-of-caste-in-the-diasporas-6e5a27cd82ef#.xx82xrhfh&#34;&gt;Spearheading a Survey of Caste in South Asian Diasporas&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; There&amp;rsquo;s some background in this article, with personal stories, and link to a survey set up by the Dalit American Foundation and co-sponsored by Ambedkar International Mission, Ambedkar Association of North America, and the Dalit American Women’s Federation. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating look into how the caste system works among the Indian diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/amateur-sociology-considered-harmful/&#34;&gt;Amateur Sociology Considered Harmful&lt;/a&gt; [Things of Things] &amp;ndash; A highly recommended post on the pitfalls of amateur sociology &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s fun but we have to be much more careful about assuming it actually describes the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/for-kidney-health-roller-coaster-therapy/501278/&#34;&gt;A Health Benefit of Roller Coasters&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; This is truly wacky research. In a unique, home-spun experiment, researchers found that centripetal force could help people pass kidney stones—before they become a serious health care cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html&#34;&gt;Peter Thiel, Trump’s Tech Pal, Explains Himself&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times] &amp;ndash; An interview with Peter Thiel about his behavior during the last presidential election. His responses make it evidently clear that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t fully considered the damaging positions of the candidate he supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html&#34;&gt;Democracies end when they are too democratic&lt;/a&gt; [NYMag] &amp;ndash; An article from May that I finally managed to read. While I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with all points, it now comes across as extremely prescient about the events that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.e9vzbei2p&#34;&gt;Trial Balloon for a Coup?&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; This is a speculative article that argues that the current administration&amp;rsquo;s imposition of the Muslim ban, then backing off on some points, followed by the confusion that followed was a way of testing the limits of the system. Quoting, &amp;ldquo;Yesterday was the trial balloon for a coup d’état against the United States. It gave them useful information&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jakefuentes/the-immigration-ban-is-a-headfake-and-were-falling-for-it-b8910e78f0c5#.wcck2msz1&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; that constructs a similar hypothesis &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;We’ve just tested the country’s willingness to capitulate to a fascist regime&amp;rdquo;. On the second article, I disagree with the tone that protests have limited efficacy, but agree that much bigger and stronger organization is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:522ff2422ef90d5eff638eb49e6ceed5&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched several good movies this month, though there are still more I have to catch up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4341582/&#34;&gt;Queen of Katwe&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A feel-good movie about a little girl in Uganda who&amp;rsquo;s a Chess prodigy, and goes on to rapidly achieve great success. The best part is that this is based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, who grew up in a slum in Katwe, learned to play Chess there, and eventually became an international champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4900716/&#34;&gt;Kapoor &amp;amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d watched this movie before, but watched it again on the flight back to San Francisco. I think it needs a mention, because even after the second watch, it was an extremely well-made and delicately sensitive Bollywood movie. It surely is one of my favorite Hindi movies from the new generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5946128/&#34;&gt;Dear Zindagi&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Another Hindi movie that deserves a mention. Bollywood tends to poorly treat many complex issues, and mental health remains one of them, so it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to see a generally mature movie centered around mental health issues and therapy (which is still a big taboo in India).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/&#34;&gt;La La Land&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Nominated for 14 academy awards, and every bit worth that. Each frame feels like art, and Emma Stone in particular is a very good actress. That said, there&amp;rsquo;s something ironic about a movie about saving Jazz with all-white cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Adronitis</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/adronitis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 15:09:14 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/adronitis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a word that struck me immediately. I found it on one of those &lt;a href=&#34;http://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2016/02/40-words-for-emotions-youve-felt-but-couldnt-explain/3/&#34;&gt;listicles&lt;/a&gt;
that pull up obscure words that mean very specific things, and then advertize to
young adults trying to make sense of their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adronitis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;n. frustration with how long it takes to get to know someone—spending the first few weeks chatting in their psychological entryway, with each subsequent conversation like entering a different anteroom, each a little closer to the center of the house—wishing instead that you could start there and work your way out, exchanging your deepest secrets first, before easing into casualness, until you’ve built up enough mystery over the years to ask them where they’re from, and what they do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to bet this is not even a real word &amp;ndash; searching didn&amp;rsquo;t yield
conclusive results. But the meaning, and imagery it depicts, is spot on, and something
I&amp;rsquo;ve strongly felt about making friends lately.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Being a Tourist in India</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/on-being-tourist-in-india/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 12:59:04 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/on-being-tourist-in-india/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got back to California after spending four full weeks in India. My
previous trip was two years ago, at the end
of 2014. Until moving to the US in 2012, I&amp;rsquo;d only ever lived in India.
Immediately after moving, life in California seemed very attractive, especially by
virtue of the things India could not offer (primarily better facilities,
a more peaceful lifestyle, and opportunities for individual growth). Whenever I visited
India after that, I&amp;rsquo;d often complain about the lack of infrastructure, pollution,
poor traffic, general disorder, and a host of other problems that might
affect any developing country. Typical NRI behavior, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip was so different though! It was my first proper
long vacation in over four years, although that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain everything. Over the last
two years, my life in the US hasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly been a smooth ride, and I&amp;rsquo;ve felt
increasing loneliness, conflated with other personal struggles, including those
with healthcare and bureaucracy. All of that has surely dulled the sheen that
California once held for me. It&amp;rsquo;s not a radical idea that each place has its
problems, but to truly feel and internalize it, and move past the
first world fetishism that many in India grow up with is quite
empowering. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been extremely fortunate in the last 2-3 years to
have traveled to multiple places and made friends with people
from diverse backgrounds.
As a result, I find that I&amp;rsquo;m quite willing to look past trivial (and
sometimes even big) inconveniences and focus on the positives whenever I travel
to a new place. Once again, none of this is very unique, and seasoned travelers
are often quite patient people (I&amp;rsquo;m neither).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I felt compelled to write about this is that adopting a different attitude
made my recent India experience extremely positive. On an absolute level, the India
I went to did not feel remarkably different. Some infrastructure had improved for
sure, but a lot still felt the same. Traffic was noticeably worse, air quality poor,
and the streets dirty. These aren&amp;rsquo;t new problems, as any Indian will tell you, and
they&amp;rsquo;ve annoyed me a lot in the past. This time though, I had decided to travel like
I&amp;rsquo;d travel to any other country &amp;ndash; as a tourist. This might feel like a small thing,
but it was an epiphany. I found it easier to ignore a lot of the negative
aspects, and focus on the good things &amp;ndash; and India does have a lot of good things
to offer. In the past, I&amp;rsquo;d get tired of being in India after about three
weeks and want to return, but this time I did not quite feel like coming back. Of
course, going to India is different from visiting any other country, since I&amp;rsquo;ve
grown up there, and it remains one of the likely countries I could move to in the
future. Still, this new attitude was helpful with realizing what really mattered
and what was tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to add the disclaimer that all of this says nothing about
actually living in India&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, this is not a good attitude to adopt
if one is living in a place, since it can very easily breed apathy. Still, as I
continue to evaluate whether or not I want to move to India in the near future,
this helped me think more clearly and filter out the unimportant considerations.
Without that, I&amp;rsquo;m predisposed to hyperbolizing annoyances and never creating a
balanced picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;I often complain that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to live as an independent adult in India, since I left right after college.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:9e61b69be6f1f06be70c82f0bcc41327:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>I was Asked to Give a Motivational Speech</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/i-was-asked-motivational-speech/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2017 15:29:03 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2016, my parents celebrated the 25th anniversary of Totla Hospital.
It has been a long and impressive journey for them, starting out
from literally nothing when they arrived in Aurangabad, to having built a very
successful and highly respected hospital in the city. To celebrate this anniversary,
they had organized a grand function, inviting a lot of former patients, friends, family,
and others out of the gigantic community they&amp;rsquo;ve built during this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks prior, I was asked to speak at the event. Several people in the city know
me due to some good exam results from 2008 that got a lot of publicity,
though I have always found it hard to deal with the attention.
As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve often overcompensated and vehemently opposed anything that would
draw similar attention to me. Besides, I always maintained that good exam results
are down to a lot of luck, and mine were too long in the past anyway. So while
my first reaction was to protest the fact that I even had to speak at the event,
I later decided that this was a rare opportunity to engage with the people of
Aurangabad (the event was expected to have 1500 attendees!) and put forward my point
of view. It took me some days to come up with the key points, and roughly a day to write
them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation was that I&amp;rsquo;d say something motivational, given all my &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;.
Instead, I decided to talk about things I personally feel strongly about, including
questioning what success means. Here&amp;rsquo;s my original draft of the speech. The actual
transcript differs slightly because I improvised on stage, but it sticks to the outline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;speech-outline:c926fc76b4b01d7c5aa3351fb0bb8c80&#34;&gt;Speech Outline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good evening everyone, my name is Nishant Totla, and I&amp;rsquo;m the son of Dr Rajgopal Totla
and Santosh Totla. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how I think about success, looking
at the past. I wanted to say something motivational, but I think it is far
more important to talk about what success means and the factors
behind it, before trying to motivate others towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll only talk for 10 minutes, but my talk is meant for young
students aspiring to be successful, and their parents who want to support them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does success look like? We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen what it looks like in the newspapers.
You know, people see all these flashy results, or news about how some kid
out of college is getting a huge salary, and wonder if they&amp;rsquo;re being left behind.
Well let me tell you this &amp;ndash; news like this is meant to deceive, not inform.
It hides all the other factors that are involved in becoming a successful person.
I have done well enough in the last few years that many people consider me
successful. But from my point of view, looking back, here is what I think
contributes to success. There are, broadly speaking, four things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privilege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(and to some extent, talent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[I define what each of them mean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the only thing in your hands, is hard work. Successful people
often downplay the role of other things in their success, and they are often
as important as hard work. Don&amp;rsquo;t let any successful person tell you they were not lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an example. When my parents arrived in Aurangabad a long time
ago to start Totla Hospital, they came with no money and support,
just a strong desire to start practicing and serve people. They did not have
the privilege of a comfortable familiar place, or financial backing. But
they worked really hard, and were fortunate to be supported by some amazing people
in this journey, which makes them as successful as they are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own case, I had everything one can ask for &amp;ndash; I worked very hard, I
was lucky in many places (like not falling sick at the wrong times), and
I was very privileged because my parents supported me at every step, despite
all the inconvenience it caused them. I could not have achieved anything without
support from them, the hospital staff, family, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went to college, I met some people who had nothing like what I had.
There were people from really poor families, or very unfortunate circumstances,
who worked really hard to get there, and did well in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in Aurangabad, and grew up here for a good part of my life.
I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of times that our region lacks infrastructure and awareness
for our youth to be successful. I agree that we still have a lot of
catching up to do, and it will happen with time. But with the above points,
my message to all of you who hold aspirations to be successful is this &amp;ndash;
remember that situations will never be perfect. You will probably not get
all these things, and the only thing you can do is to be sincere in your efforts
and work hard. The rest is not always in your control. To the parents, my
message is that if your kids fail despite hard work, recognize that many other factors are involved, and don&amp;rsquo;t blame them right away. Their talents
might be elsewhere, or they might have just been unlucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I will move on to the second part &amp;ndash; what is success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I used to believe that doing well in school was success.
Then I believed doing well in competitive examinations, and getting into a good
college was success. Then I thought getting a good job was success. But after all
those things, and some more experience, I want to say that these things are
not as important as we think. Yes they help, and we must work hard towards them,
but they don&amp;rsquo;t define us. Lot of people in good colleges end up
unsuccessful, and many remarkable people in the world did not
go to a very good college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at what my parents have achieved, they have no doubt built and
done a lot of great things over the last 25 years. But the most important thing that
I believe makes them successful is their kindness and compassion for their patients.
When so many patients speak highly of them, it is not because they have great
education and degrees. It is because they understand people&amp;rsquo;s pain, empathize with
them, and they are kind. In the long term, it is these qualities that will give you
a lot more success and happiness, than just things on paper. Right now, when I
think about what I want to do in the future, it is always related to how I can
help people &amp;ndash; especially those are are poor, or lack privilege. Look at so many
rich people (such as Bill Gates), who end up living very modest lives and
help others through philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a society, we need to start telling people that it is not only these
fancy achievements that make a person successful and useful to society. The will
to help people around us, and kindness are extremely underrated qualities that
should be cultivated from a young age. Let us stop narrowly defining what success
means, and instead focus on what we can do to become happy and satisfied with
our lives. I cannot tell you how to achieve that, because you must find it
for yourself. What I can tell you though, is to work hard, and not
get caught up in narrow definitions of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ummmm:c926fc76b4b01d7c5aa3351fb0bb8c80&#34;&gt;Ummmm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, probably sounds like one of those cheesy speeches that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really say anything
actionable (because it is!), but it was my first attempt at putting these ideas out there.
More selfishly, I have started relishing the opportunity to speak publicly, thanks partly
to my job that has given me several chances to present my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;I had the outline on my phone!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have become much more
comfortable and confident on stage, and have begun treating each occasion like an
exciting opportunity to be enjoyed, rather than a scary challenge to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some old posts here, just because I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with the backlog
from the last 4-5 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:4511ef69dc4e83813633e87570ad385e&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/09/10/five-trends-shaping-india-s-voting-landscape-pub-52870&#34;&gt;Five Trends Shaping India’s Voting Landscape&lt;/a&gt; [Carnegie Endowment] &amp;ndash; Interesting analysis of voting trends and factors affecting elections in India. It touches upon some numbers illustrating patterns around voter turnout, effect of state elections, translation of votes to seats, etc. This was written before the 2014 election though, so some of the analysis might have to be changed as a result. There are more interesting articles &lt;a href=&#34;http://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/IndiaDecides2014/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@BigMeanInternet/lego-marx-de65004b8678#.ex51oew2g&#34;&gt;Lego Marx&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; This is a great read because it refines and describes very clearly the combination of intersectionality and Marxism. It talks about &amp;ldquo;materialism&amp;rdquo; as the scientific method which can be used to describe various class conflicts in the Marxism mould. It has influenced my thinking a lot recently. The article also cites an essay from the late-70s by French women’s liberation theorist Christine Delphy called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/christine-delphy-a-materialist-feminism-is-possible.pdf&#34;&gt;“A Materialist Feminism is possible”&lt;/a&gt; as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thegauntlife.blogspot.com/2016/12/running-in-trumpland.html&#34;&gt;Running in TrumpLand&lt;/a&gt; [The Gaunt Life] &amp;ndash; Sam Robinson is a long-distance runner who lives in the Bay Area. He grew up in the rural mid-west, and describes the transformation of the places he knew when young, to what they&amp;rsquo;ve become now. This is a particularly good read in the light of the recent election, and a rare perspective of someone who has actually seen and lived through the &amp;ldquo;ignored rust belt&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/magazine/what-happens-when-a-state-is-run-by-movie-stars.html&#34;&gt;What Happens When a State Is Run by Movie Stars?&lt;/a&gt; [The New York Times Magazine] &amp;ndash; An old article from last year that describes the fanatical politics of Tamil Nadu. This came up in my feed again as Jayalalithaa died earlier this month, and is a fascinating read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/i-was-a-proud-non-breeder-i-changed-my-mind.html&#34;&gt;I Was a Proud Non-Breeder. Then I Changed My Mind.&lt;/a&gt; [The Cut] &amp;ndash; Article from a journalist who had vowed to be child-free at 27 but found herself changing her mind later (for her own reasons). She explains her reasons in this post. To quote from the article &amp;ldquo;Not long ago, I learned the Arabic word Ya’aburnee from a friend’s cheesy Facebook graphic. Literally, “you bury me,” it means wanting to die before a loved one so as not to have to face the world without him or her in it. It’s a word that captures exactly my feeling for my husband. Part of the reason I didn’t want kids was because I feared they’d come between us, but if he were gone, I’d be frantic to hold on to a piece of him. Grasping this didn’t make me want a baby, exactly, but it started pushing me from “no” to, well, ambivalent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/12/movie-doesn-t-exist-and-redditors-who-think-it-does&#34;&gt;The movie that doesn’t exist and the Redditors who think it does&lt;/a&gt; [NewStatesman] &amp;ndash; Over the years, hundreds of people online have shared memories of a cheesy nineties movie called “Shazaam”. There is no evidence that such a film was ever made. This article talks about the quirks of collective memory. There&amp;rsquo;s also a subreddit that abounds in things like these: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/&#34;&gt;/r/MandelaEffect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/&#34;&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I binged through Season 1 of this gripping alternative history series, which imagines what the world might have looked like had the Allies lost WWII. Highly recommended for history buffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:4511ef69dc4e83813633e87570ad385e&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alltheflightdeals.com&#34;&gt;All the Flight Deals&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for new innovative attempts to find cheap flight deals. This new one came up on my feed, and the UX is designed to show the cheapest tickets out of an airport to &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in the world. Useful when you want to plan a vacation based on ticket availability. There are some more features as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indivisibleguide.com/&#34;&gt;Indivisible: A Practical Guide For Resisting the Trump Agenda&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A really comprehensive collection of information where former congressional staffers reveal best practices for making Congress listen. This is in response to the urgent to form a front against the racist and bigoted agenda of the incoming administration. This originally started out as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzOz3Y6D8g_MNXHNMJYAz1b41_cn535aU5UsN7Lj8X8/mobilebasic&#34;&gt;Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s also a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-crowd-sourced-guide-to-fighting-trumps-agenda&#34;&gt;New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt; describing the story behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a short Docker tutorial for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine&#34;&gt;Netmag&lt;/a&gt;, a UK magazine. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done something like this, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited! The issue goes on sale in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/videos&#34;&gt;The School of Life YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A series of eclectic and interesting short videos on various philosophical topics. The perfect content for watching during breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Alison Jackson&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Alison Jackson is a British artist, and some of her art portrays the &amp;ldquo;intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons&amp;rdquo;. These aren&amp;rsquo;t real images, but very intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://anchoreditions.com/blog/dorothea-lange-censored-photographs&#34;&gt;Dorothea Lange’s Censored Photographs of FDR’s Japanese Concentration Camps&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Dorothea Lange was hired by the U.S. government to make a photographic record of the &amp;ldquo;evacuation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;relocation&amp;rdquo; of Japanese-Americans in 1942. She was eager to take the commission, despite being opposed to the effort, as she believed &amp;ldquo;a true record of the evacuation would be valuable in the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It deconstructs the [sic] politically motivated social engineering of Germany by the Nazi regime. Pretty relevant today, and a sad reminder of how much the US has regressed in the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/&#34;&gt;/r/churning&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I recently learned of this subreddit for learning more about hacking credit card rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>2016 Year in Review</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/2016-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 01:20:02 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/2016-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Precisely a year ago, I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/off-to-hawaii&#34;&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; to try and
regain some sanity after what was a terrible 2015.
It offered little apart from endless pain, suffering, depression,
lack of community, and an uncontrollable feeling of helplessness.
So much so that the second half of the Hawaii trip was full of
panic attacks and attempts to cut the trip short. I was due to start a new job upon returning, and my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis was still pending. I had no idea how I was going
to deal after getting back, manage personal relationships, and stop feeling
that life was pointless every other day&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 for me was a story in two parts &amp;ndash; pre-September, and post. The first part was
incredibly hard with a few positive blips, while the second was rosy,
with renewed hope going into 2017. I&amp;rsquo;m going to avoid any mention of politics
in this post, even though the events of the year deeply affected me on a personal level.
Although 2016 was painful to live through, it will be memorable. This is a feeling
I had failed to experience for several years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;master-s-thesis:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of my woes was my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, which had dragged out for too long. After
failing to finish it at the end of 2015 and getting on filing fee status&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, expecting
to get done with it by February. But lack of progress for extended periods (in part due
to severe depression), coupled with a full-time job, and spending most of my free time
struggling with the thesis was a recipe for disaster. I failed to finish it by the May
deadline, had to register for the summer session (and pay nearly $2000 for it). Despite
finally managing to make good progress by the end of July and get a draft ready,
my committee refused to sign it, and the EECS department showed an immense lack
of desire to help me out. This left me looking at a $16000 tuition payment for the Fall
semester. I fought the bureaucracy and it was only in mid-November that I managed
to get the thesis submitted, in time to extend my immigration status, without which
I&amp;rsquo;d be forced to leave the country. The details of that
will be the subject of another post, but if there&amp;rsquo;s a lesson to be learned, it is that
&lt;em&gt;the department is not your friend&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/commencement.gif&#34; style=&#34;width:70%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Commencement - Pradeep walked on the same day&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, after over four years of struggle at UC Berkeley, I&amp;rsquo;m finally out of that
depressing environment and looking at better things, with at least a degree to show.
I even got to walk for commencement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this front, the year was mostly bad. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned depression a few times
already, but 2016 was remarkable because I&amp;rsquo;m
finally ending a year on a reasonably good note. If the first half was about
lack of motivation, often to the extent of death ideation, then the second half
presented a renewed faith in my own abilities, along with a future that I at least
want to consider. Thanks to input from my girlfriend and some close friends, I also
got the opportunity to deeply introspect and work on personal flaws that have
always caused me great anxiety. Health issues for someone very close to me
were also a factor in an utterly disappointing time for the first part of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I continued to work on my chronic physical injuries, with the hope of
one day getting back to endurance running and biking. I have a pretty solid understanding
of shoulder and hip anatomy as a result, and have tried literally every rehab technique
out there. Hopefully 2017 is the year I get a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working at Docker as a software engineer in early 2016.
I recovered some of the productivity I lost during grad
school, and got several new opportunities and experiences along the way. For one,
I learned a lot about working on open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/github.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;My GitHub profile has never looked greener&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I got to &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/conference-travel-2016&#34;&gt;travel to multiple conferences&lt;/a&gt;
and give talks. These were among the primary reasons I had joined Docker in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/talk.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;First conference talk, at ContainerCamp 2016, London&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were slow periods too, but the year was overall a positive change on the work front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all problems, 2016 was one of the best years for travel. Traveling was
easier since I had more money, opportunities, and time (post September).
I did make several trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boulder and Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (May) for a long weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seattle and Olympic National Park, Washington (June) for DockerCon, extended the trip by a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crater Lake National Park, Oregon (July) for a random weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/colorado.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/craterlake.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;White snow at 12,000ft in Rocky Mountain National Park, and deep blue water at Crater Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London, UK (September) for ContainerCamp, spent 4 extra days exploring the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Louis, Missouri (September) for Strange Loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike camping trip to Samuel P Taylor State Park (September)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin, Germany (October) for the Docker Distributed Systems Summit, plus 3 extra days to explore the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mendocino, California (October) for a relaxing weekend getaway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/london.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/bikecamping.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/berlin.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/mendocino.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;London, start of the bike camping trip in SF, festival of lights at the Berliner Dom, California coastline in Mendocino&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portland, Oregon (November) for a friend&amp;rsquo;s bachelor trip weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maui, Hawaii (November) for the Thanksgiving break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo, Japan (December) for vacation, and (finally) a new country for 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India (December), also for vacation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/portland.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/maui.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/2016-year-in-review/tokyo.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:80%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hipster Indian food in Portland, stunning ridges in Maui, street market in Tokyo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this includes 3 international trips, 4 national parks, and several new
cities. I also spend a lot of time exploring locally in Oakland and San Francisco.
Up until the late May trip to Colorado, the only travel I had done was a weekend
trip to Seattle in March, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad with the way things turned out in the second
half of the year&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-highlights:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Other Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fulfilled a long standing dream of watching Arsenal play at the Emirates stadium. During my trip to London in September, I managed to get a ticket to the Arsenal vs Southampton game and thoroughly enjoyed it. Interestingly, just the month before, I&amp;rsquo;d watched the team play MLS All-Stars during their US tour but had no idea I&amp;rsquo;d actually be traveling to London soon after!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Arsenal vs Southampton at the Emirates Stadium in September&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a short Docker tutorial for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine&#34;&gt;Netmag&lt;/a&gt;, a UK magazine. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done something like this, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited! The issue goes on sale in late January 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some close friends got married (and several others got engaged). Wedding season was a lot of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After several years of being indifferent, I celebrated my birthday (in difficult circumstances too, following my thesis rejection!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vasuki, Vaishnavi, and I organized a Bollywood costume themed Diwali party at our apartment, the first such party I&amp;rsquo;ve been part of organizing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My adventure of the year was jumping into the freezing cold water of Crater Lake, after failing to carry swimming shorts but judging that the opportunity was not to be missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;After some hiking on Wizard Island, I found the courage to jump into the frigid waters of Crater Lake! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/8Z2L1XKchn&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8Z2L1XKchn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Traveler Boy (@nrt_travel) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nrt_travel/status/754849467581341696&#34;&gt;July 18, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/why-i-moved-to-static-website&#34;&gt;current version of my website and blog&lt;/a&gt; this year. It was a lot of work, but has been a net positive effort because it encouraged me to write more easily and frequently (hopefully more next year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-at-2017:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17&#34;&gt;Looking at 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a private list of specific goals to pursue to next year, but the most
important thing I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to is settling down. For
too long now, life has felt like someone else in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat, and I want to
end that. Hopefully, that will free up some time to devote to things I actually care
about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;The irony here is that I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty privileged and &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo;, and that only adds up to a lot of guilt. One of my major goals is to get over this chronic depression.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;A special kind of student registration that you can avail when only a thesis is due, and all course requirements are done. The upside is that you&amp;rsquo;re no longer required to pay tuition and can get a job.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a curious thing how despite being utterly depressed for long periods, my travelogue is pretty elaborate. It was more chance than anything that I managed to cover as much ground as I did, but satisfying that I took the opportunities that came my way. When I tried to reach out to a friend saying I was really sad, he mentioned that&amp;rsquo;s not at all how my Instagram profile looked like. Now you have another example of the pain hidden behind glittery social media profiles.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:fb87175bd9d8d1c271c0241c5bfcdf17:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>August-November 2016</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Given all the travel and being busy over August to November, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get
much time to write or update the monthly log. I&amp;rsquo;m finally able to put something
together at the end of November, collecting everything for the last four months
in one place. These months have not only been eventful personally, but also politically.
The fallout of the election of Donald Trump has affected me a lot, and forced me to read
a lot more than I usually do. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover through everything in this log, and the
following one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37527719&#34;&gt;Has the US just given away the internet?&lt;/a&gt; [BBC News] &amp;ndash; A brief overview article that describes the background behind the recent decision to remove ICANN from US government oversight. Quoting the article, &amp;ldquo;The switch ends a transition that has essentially been in the works for around two decades, removing a dominant power the US had by circumstance rather than intention, and one which was causing friction in the international community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@theonlytoby/history-tells-us-what-will-happen-next-with-brexit-trump-a3fefd154714#.vsypl0lw8&#34;&gt;History tells us what may happen next with Brexit &amp;amp; Trump&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; Several people are eager to dismiss Donald Trump as just another Republican
president. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m extremely paranoid and afraid given the striking similarities
between Trump and many other fascist authoritarian demagogues littered throughout history.
This article (not the only one) articulates why that paranoia isn&amp;rsquo;t pointless rambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jhalderm/want-to-know-if-the-election-was-hacked-look-at-the-ballots-c61a6113b0ba#.wr4h9scx8&#34;&gt;Want to Know if the Election was Hacked? Look at the Ballots&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; A Computer Science professor from Michigan writes about how the implementation
of elections in America is extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks. While a lot of the
talk on &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; the election has already been done in mainstream media, several people
probably still treat it as science fiction. This article presents how it&amp;rsquo;s entirely
possible, and has probably already happened. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/05/us-election-recount-michigan-donald-trump-hillary-clinton&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a Guardian news story&lt;/a&gt; that shows
how the Michigan recount might be affected just by shoddy machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/11/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival/&#34;&gt;Autocracy: Rules for Survival&lt;/a&gt; [NYR Daily] &amp;ndash; Wisdom from a seasoned Putin fighter, Masha Gessen, on how to deal with a Putin-wannabe. In her own words, &amp;ldquo;I have lived in autocracies most of my life, and have spent much of my career writing about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. I have learned a few rules for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and self-respect. It might be worth considering them now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/&#34;&gt;Intellectual Hipsters and Meta-Contrarianism&lt;/a&gt; [LessWrong] &amp;ndash; An old post I&amp;rsquo;d read a long
time ago, and pulled up again recently. Based on the (mostly political) discussions over
the last few weeks, it has felt extremely relevant. I strongly recommend reading this
post. On several issues, I feel that my own behavior has shifted around from
&amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;contrarian&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;meta-contrarian&amp;rdquo; (back and forth too). The
important point is in the conclusion &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;If meta-contrarianism is a real tendency in
over-intelligent people, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should immediately abandon their beliefs;
that would just be meta-meta-contrarianism. It means that they need to recognize the
meta-contrarian tendency within themselves and so be extra suspicious and careful about
a desire to believe something contrary to the prevailing contrarian wisdom, especially
if they really enjoy doing so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of other election coverage I&amp;rsquo;ve shared on Twitter, Facebook, or in direct
messages to people. There&amp;rsquo;s also some more I&amp;rsquo;d like to add here, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/opinion/sunday/why-blue-states-are-the-real-tea-party.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/hillary-clinton-working-class/509477&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.salon.com/2016/12/03/fake-news-a-fake-president-and-a-fake-country-welcome-to-america-land-of-no-context/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;books:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to get back to reading more. I&amp;rsquo;ve barely read any books this year, but I
did manage to finish one that I started way back in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird&#34;&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve read really few books all my life, much less classics. It&amp;rsquo;s a striking commentary on race and how it functions in America (including, in my opinion, up to the modern day).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to travel the following places during this time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London, UK &amp;ndash; For the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/containercamp-pwlconf-strangeloop&#34;&gt;ContainerCamp&lt;/a&gt; conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;St. Louis, Missouri &amp;ndash; For the &lt;a href=&#34;(/blog/containercamp-pwlconf-strangeloop&#34;&gt;PWLConf and Strange Loop&lt;/a&gt;) conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berlin, Germany &amp;ndash; For the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/containercamp-pwlconf-strangeloop&#34;&gt;Docker Distributed Systems Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maui, Hawaii &amp;ndash; For vacation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this travel, despite being very tiring, was a great deal of fun and made me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334&#34;&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Everyone has raved about this show enough, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to write a lot, but the charm of 80s suburban America (I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of this on TV growing up) creats a nostalgia factor for a time that I never lived. It reminded me a lot of the X-Files as well. The Soundtrack is memorable too. Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/175929311&#34;&gt;video link&lt;/a&gt; for references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2401256/&#34;&gt;The Night Of&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A short series that I&amp;rsquo;d label as a dark criminal justice drama. I highly recommend this to anyone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in that kind of thing. The slow-paced movement with powerful character development makes it quite a gripping series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4818930/&#34;&gt;Waiting&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A sensible Bollywood drama that shows two individuals coping in different ways with the loss of their respective spouses, and finding friendship in each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5743656/&#34;&gt;Phobia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A good Bollywood thriller, after a long time. Good performance by Radhika Apte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948356/&#34;&gt;Zootopia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Like most good animated movies, Zootopia is funny and well-made. The reason it stood out for me though, was because it portrays social classes really well. Think discrimination, stereotypes, oppression &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5571734/&#34;&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Another good Bollywood movie, this time a criminal justice drama, built around the issues of sexual assualt and consent. One of the more mature presentations on the topic in Bollywood, especially given its reputation of miserably failing on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:32da4def5c89171ea5d9ed8eeb1daa50&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wonder-bot.com/&#34;&gt;Wonder Bot&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A chat bot that you can tell something, and it&amp;rsquo;ll remember for you. Basically a natural-language KV store of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos&#34;&gt;Phile YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; A series of easy to understand videos on various topics, like computer science, mathematics, philosophy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QzAl4HIXY8&#34;&gt;Coke Studio for the Deaf&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; How would a deaf person percieve and experience music? This video explores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/13/us/politics/david-mccraw-trump-letter.html&#34;&gt;The Times’s Lawyer Responds to Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Just pretty badass. With the current state of politics, we do need more fearless journalism and patronage for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
