&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:644a9c6ec0be42ecc309e552f878dc56&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pulitzer prizes were announced last week, and I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to catch up on a couple of interesting articles that won. This week I could only do one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one&#34;&gt;The Really Big One&lt;/a&gt; [The New Yorker] &amp;ndash; This is a great piece of journalism, describing how the Pacific Northwest is due for a MAJOR earthquake. This is not one of your regular doomsday articles &amp;ndash; it goes through a great deal of background (made understandable for the non-expert) and history behind the tectonic activity in the region. It also describes how poorly equipped the region really is to deal with the consequences, and how things will go down if this earthquake hits in the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were other nice articles that came up in my various feeds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/&#34;&gt;Shields Down&lt;/a&gt; [randsinrepose] &amp;ndash; Job resignations don&amp;rsquo;t happen when you decide you&amp;rsquo;re doing it. They happen when a certain event or situation leads you to lower your shields and consider the possibility of an alternative future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/&#34;&gt;Bored People Quit&lt;/a&gt; [randsinrepose] &amp;ndash; A post for engineering managers to detect boredom in their teams, and how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/this-is-hard/the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e#.7ll31ndb5&#34;&gt;The Other Side of Diversity&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; An old article by the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EricaJoy&#34;&gt;Erica Baker&lt;/a&gt; describing her experience with how diversity in the workplace is also about helping marginalized groups build communities for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:644a9c6ec0be42ecc309e552f878dc56&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ali Zafar again üíúüíúüíú alongside Sara Haider, with this rendition of a beautiful song from 1963 sung by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleem_Raza_(Pakistani_singer&#34;&gt;Saleem Raza&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;rsquo;ve been sadder than usual this week, but listening to this song helped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/222734241&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been letting Soundcloud just play suggested music in the background, and discovered some interesting stuff as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/97173470&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
James Blunt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Your Beautiful&amp;rdquo; translated to Punjabi, pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/167677079&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
I discovered this acapella version of Strings&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Mera Bichra Yaar&amp;rdquo; two weeks ago, but found it again and really loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217632953&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t have (and didn&amp;rsquo;t find out) much background about this track, but it&amp;rsquo;s good nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far these suggestions have been üëåüëèü§òand I&amp;rsquo;ve just kept the tab open as an anytime go-to radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:644a9c6ec0be42ecc309e552f878dc56&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I subscribed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://modelviewculture.com/&#34;&gt;Model View Culture&lt;/a&gt; and hope to keep in touch with some extremely thought-provoking writings there. It describes itself as a magazine about technology, culture and diversity. Highly recommended!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:98abedd9c62a85bccb8ad1cb2fde3ebf&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/pornography-industry-economics-tarrant/476580/&#34;&gt;The Hidden Economics of Porn&lt;/a&gt; [The Atlantic] &amp;ndash; Some very intriguing insights about the porn industy by a gender-studies professor. The porn industry is really BIG, many big-name sites are owned by a single company (MindGeek) and contain pirated content. It&amp;rsquo;s also very interesting to know that porn preferences of people are shaped by the keywords they use, which only reflect some stereotyped categories (that are often sexist, racist, or narrow-minded). Overall, the article contains several questions that ought to be asked about our relationship to porn and our consumption of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@milistjohn/i-am-alex-st-john-s-daughter-and-he-is-wrong-about-women-in-tech-4728545e7c0e#.o0x2dflzr&#34;&gt;I am Alex St. John‚Äôs Daughter, and He is Wrong About Women in Tech&lt;/a&gt; [Medium] &amp;ndash; A fitting reply to the misogynistic and regressive views publicly peddled by Alex St. John, by his own daughter Amilia. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-written response that details her own experiences and why her father&amp;rsquo;s views are misguided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies-and-tv-shows:98abedd9c62a85bccb8ad1cb2fde3ebf&#34;&gt;Movies and TV Shows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/&#34;&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s a British TV anthology series that features speculative fiction with dark and satirical themes examining modern society, especially wrt the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. I started watching this week, and have liked it a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:98abedd9c62a85bccb8ad1cb2fde3ebf&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://camlistore.org/&#34;&gt;Camlistore&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; From the website, &amp;ldquo;Camlistore is a set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been worrying about backing up my data for a while, especially with the amount of trust I currently need to have in Google or other third-party tools. I&amp;rsquo;ll be following Camlistore closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gmail.googleblog.com/2016/04/inbox-by-gmail-better-way-to-keep-track.html&#34;&gt;Saving links to Google Inbox&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Google recently announced a Chrome extension for saving links directly into Inbox, and they get bundled too! This is an amazing feature since I did often use Inbox to do the same. &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; has serious competition! This also works on the phone app, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t see bundling there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles:95bd810bcc3ec763a4760e676ae3a6d6&#34;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/&#34;&gt;Beware Trivial Inconveniences&lt;/a&gt; [LessWrong] &amp;ndash; This is a nice post about how The Great Firewall of China works by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, thereby discouraging casual exploration. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s easy to bypass it with little technical knowledge or instructions, most people don&amp;rsquo;t do it. There are many more situations where it&amp;rsquo;s easy to discourage people from doing certain things simply by making them slightly inconvenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;music:95bd810bcc3ec763a4760e676ae3a6d6&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended my first &lt;strong&gt;Anoushka Shankar&lt;/strong&gt; concert this week. Despite not having been a huge fan of her music in the past, I fell in love with the performance and the music. Perhaps my tastes are changing now. Music was from her new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVd3o9OuyxM&amp;amp;list=PLGjLVtehjLeV_z6twUDRKzDkJFhzYbXIV&#34;&gt;Land of Gold album&lt;/a&gt;. Especially look out for the Secret Heart, Land to Nowhere, and Dissolving Boundaries tracks. The album is inspired by the pain and frustration of the recent refugee crisis, and reflects both anger and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Equivalnce&#34;&gt;Abhinav&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to a couple of cool Coke Studio (Season 8) songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/220247852&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
Umair Jaswal and Quratulain Balouch are amazing singers, and I particularly adore the flute and violins in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/220248535&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
This one is all about Ali Zafar. I always thought he was a good performer, but his vocal range and swagger are stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both the above, the videos are worth watching too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another source of new music was &lt;a href=&#34;http://bolly923fm.com/&#34;&gt;Bolly 92.3 FM&lt;/a&gt;, Bay Area&amp;rsquo;s new Bollywood-only radio channel! I can&amp;rsquo;t describe how glad I am to have this, even though a lot of modern Bollywood music is very forgettable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous:95bd810bcc3ec763a4760e676ae3a6d6&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slither.io/&#34;&gt;Slither&lt;/a&gt; is an online multiplayer snake game, with 400-600 players on a board at any point of time. It&amp;rsquo;s wildly addictive, and has been my second-most visited site behind Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.betterthansmalltalk.com/#end-small-talk&#34;&gt;Better Than Small Talk&lt;/a&gt; was an experimental event I attended this week, where the focus was to create an atmosphere that encouraged people to quickly dive into deep conversations. It was interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;ve written more about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/better-than-small-talk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started learning about online security and encryption, and wrote a couple of blog posts about it (&lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/playing-with-keybase-io&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/signing-git-commits-gpg&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a Weekly Log</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/creating-weekly-log/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 15:27:06 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/creating-weekly-log/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got a cool idea from &lt;a href=&#34;http://thirld.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Constantin&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. On a more or less monthly basis, he writes about the books, podcasts, and other stuff he reads. I thought that this was great for two reasons &amp;ndash; firstly for keeping track of interesting things which are otherwise too easy to move past and forget, and secondly (for me) building motivation to actually find and engage with more such things, because I get to write about them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So starting this week, I will try to write a weekly note on the books, articles, music, movies, websites, observations, and pretty much anything that comes up during the week. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to publish on Sundays, but there&amp;rsquo;s no pressure to stick to a strict schedule. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first post is &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/weekly-log-2016-04-17&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. All posts are tagged &lt;code&gt;weekly-log&lt;/code&gt;, so you can check the entire list &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/tags/weekly-log&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Signing Git Commits with a GPG Key</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/signing-git-commits-gpg/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 14:18:26 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/signing-git-commits-gpg/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/blog/playing-with-keybase-io/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I described public key encryption and how you can generate new PGP keys using &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/&#34;&gt;Keybase&lt;/a&gt;. That was just a start, and PGP keys have several uses. One of the first things I wanted to do was to start signing all my Git commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-sign-commits:2956a9e0886a6b1ebeb547ba30f1e87b&#34;&gt;Why Sign Commits?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above) introduced the ability to sign commits using a GPG key. A signed commit can be verified to make sure that you wrote the code that you claim you did. If you write software as part of a small team where everyone physically meets each other, you likely don&amp;rsquo;t need to do it, but for many open source projects where contributors often never meet physically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mikegerwitz.com/papers/git-horror-story&#34;&gt;this becomes important&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Docker, we ask contributors to sign their commits using their email id (the &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; option)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git commit -s -m &amp;quot;commit message&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much, except for adding a &lt;code&gt;Signed-off-by&lt;/code&gt; line to your commit message, picking up your &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/&#34;&gt;name and email&lt;/a&gt; from the Git config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git log -1
commit 17cc085744936123a023b1535f9adadd2f180332
Author: Nishant Totla &amp;lt;nishanttotla@gmail.com&amp;gt;
Date:   Thu Apr 7 14:17:32 2016 -0700

    commit message

    Signed-off-by: Nishant Totla &amp;lt;nishanttotla@gmail.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously easy to fake, and not as trustworthy as signing your commits with a trusted GPG key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to encryption, this guide will hopefully help you get started with signing commits. I use a Mac, so make sure to adapt instructions to your environment. If you already have GPG installed, and a key in your keyring, then you can jump to the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-a-key:2956a9e0886a6b1ebeb547ba30f1e87b&#34;&gt;Setting up a Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on exporting your Keybase key to GPG, and moving from there. If you want to generate a key using GPG, there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto&#34;&gt;other articles&lt;/a&gt; you might want to read first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install GPG using Homebrew&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install gpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fresh install, and we generated a PGP key using Keybase earlier (so it&amp;rsquo;s not part of the GPG keyring). It can be exported easily though&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ keybase pgp export --secret &amp;gt; secret-key.asc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stores the secret key into the file &lt;code&gt;secret-key.asc&lt;/code&gt;. This is temporary and MUST be deleted as soon as the import to GPG is finished&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import secret-key.asc
gpg: key 9B3D0C19: secret key imported
gpg: key 9B3D0C19: public key &amp;quot;Nishant Totla &amp;lt;nishanttotla@gmail.com&amp;gt;&amp;quot; imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The import succeeded, &lt;code&gt;9B3D0C19&lt;/code&gt; is the shortened public key signature. Make sure you delete &lt;code&gt;secret-key.asc&lt;/code&gt;. If you type &lt;code&gt;gpg --list-keys&lt;/code&gt;, you should be able to see the key that was just added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-the-key-to-git-config:2956a9e0886a6b1ebeb547ba30f1e87b&#34;&gt;Adding the Key to Git Config&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git needs to know which key to sign your commits with. Providing that information is dead simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git config --global user.signingkey 9B3D0C19
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also set a project-specific key with the &lt;code&gt;--local&lt;/code&gt; flag instead. That&amp;rsquo;s it! Now you can start signing commits with the &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt; flag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git commit -S -m &amp;quot;commit message&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt; is different from &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt;. The former signs with a GPG key, the latter only adds a &lt;code&gt;Signed-off-by&lt;/code&gt; line to the commit message. You can certainly use both together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt; each time, but fortunately Git allows you add a setting to always sign commits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tried a commit with the new setup, and checked the commit logs, you might see a small issue&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, despite having spent so many years studying Computer Science, my understanding of security and modern best practices is pretty shabby. I&amp;rsquo;m fixing that now, and it was a perfect opportunity when a friend invited me to try &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/&#34;&gt;keybase.io&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s still an Alpha product, and invite-only (or sign up and join the waitlist). I learned new things while trying it out, and wanted to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-primer-on-pgp-gpg-encryption:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;A Primer on PGP/GPG encryption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was a program created to encrypt/decrypt data back in 1991, and was later incorporated into a company that is now owned by Symantec. Later, an open standard called OpenPGP was created, which contained the formats for keys, encrypted messages, and message signatures defined by PGP. Thus, any other software that implemented the OpenPGP standard could interact with PGP. The GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is one such implementation. It&amp;rsquo;s open source, part of the GNU project, and has become standard software, powering a huge chunk of encryption on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way these work is that you first generate a public and private key using a program on your computer. As the names suggest, the private key is a secret, while the public key can be made available publicly. When someone wants to send a message, they encrypt it using your public key. This is equivalent to a mathematical operation that&amp;rsquo;s computationally very hard to reverse, unless you have the corresponding private key. On the other hand, you can use your private key to &amp;ldquo;sign&amp;rdquo; a message, which can only be decrypted using your public key. This is useful to prove that the message is indeed coming from you&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This shows how you can send a verified (signed) and encrypted message to a friend that is secure and tamper-evident&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-web-of-trust:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;The Web of Trust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important questions now need to be asked of OpenPGP compatible systems &amp;ndash; how sure are you that the person who sent you an encrypted message actually holds the private key that signed it? Or how do you know that the public key you used to encrypt an important message doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually belong to an impostor? The point is that it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to have encryption, you also need to be able to trust ownership of keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are typically two ways to solve this problem - either using hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), or the Web of Trust. The former relies on an implicitly trusted authority to certify public keys. If the authority certifies a user, then you can trust them. In the latter, individuals who own keys can vouch for each other. Suppose Alice trusts Bob, and wants to vouch for him, she can do so by signing his public key, thereby guaranteeing to everybody that Bob&amp;rsquo;s key indeed does belong to Bob. Of course, someone needs to vouch for Alice, and so on. What this does is that it creates a &amp;ldquo;web&amp;rdquo; of trust, with individuals certifying each other. Now if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering if you can trust Edward, you need to find someone who trusts someone who trusts someone &amp;hellip; eventually leading to Edward. The more such paths to Edward you can find, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an oversimplification, and there are many interesting technical details which I encourage you to read online. Additionally, PGP and GPG have had interesting histories, which are also worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-is-keybase:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;So What is Keybase?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keybase is a trusted database for public keys, where you can list your public encryption key, so that anyone wishing to send you an encrypted message can use it to do so. Even though public key encryption has been around for a while, it has usually been confined to security experts and enthusiasts, partly because most tools/clients have been notoriously &lt;a href=&#34;https://ariejan.net/2014/04/03/pretty-difficult-privacy/&#34;&gt;hard to use&lt;/a&gt;, and mainstream software hasn&amp;rsquo;t really integrated encryption as a first-class feature. Keybase is aiming to solve this problem by making it easy to generate and manage keys and devices, essentially bringing encryption to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/keybase-io/pgp-xkcd.png&#34; style=&#34;width:40%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&#34;If you want to be extra safe, check that there&#39;s a big block of jumbled characters at the bottom.&#34; (Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1181/&#34;&gt;xkcd/1181&lt;/a&gt;, joking that even the existence of a signature likely means it&#39;s genuine.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keybase also uses a different approach to establishing trust, using your accounts on public websites, instead of relying on a web of trust. If you trust that I control the &lt;a title=&#34;Twitter&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-twitter&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;/nishanttotla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Github&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nishanttotla&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-github-circled&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;/nishanttotla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&#34;Hacker News&#34; href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nishanttotla&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-hacker-news&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;/nishanttotla&lt;/a&gt; accounts, then all of them saying that my public key is indeed mine gives you more confidence in my public key. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://greglturnquist.com/2014/10/what-keybase-is-and-is-not-and-why-im.html&#34;&gt;difficult&lt;/a&gt; to establish a web of trust, especially with people that you don&amp;rsquo;t meet face to face that often. But the more public accounts under my name can verify my public key, the more trustworthy it becomes. Besides who am I, if not the sum of my online presence? üò∏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keybase now also allows you to manage multiple devices and them share keys, without actually having to move private keys around directly. Finally, the recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs&#34;&gt;Keybase File System&lt;/a&gt; allows you to create public, signed directories and securely share files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signup process is straightforward, you create an account on the website. From that point, you can do all of the following operations using the website, the official Keybase command line client, or your own GPG setup. I chose the second one. Installing the client is easy using Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install keybase
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, you can log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ keybase login
‚ñ∂ INFO Saving /Users/NishantTotla/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.keybase.plist
‚ñ∂ INFO Starting homebrew.mxcl.keybase
How would you like to sign this install of Keybase?

(1) Use an existing device
(2) Use a paper key
(3) Use my Keybase passphrase
Choose a signing option: 3
Your keybase username or email address: nishanttotla
Please enter the Keybase passphrase for nishanttotla (12+ characters): *****
Enter a public name for this device: Nishant-MBP

===============================
IMPORTANT: PAPER KEY GENERATION
===============================

During Keybase&#39;s alpha, everyone gets a paper key. This is a private key.
  1. you must write it down
  2. the first two words are a public label
  3. it can be used to recover data
  4. it can provision new keys/devices, so put it in your wallet
  5. just like any other device, it&#39;ll be revokable/replaceable if you lose it

Your paper key is

  ****** ****** ****** ****** ******

Write it down....now!

Have you written down the above paper key? [y/N] y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really straightforward, and it also additionally generates a &amp;ldquo;paper key&amp;rdquo;, which can be used to authenticate and provision Keybase on other devices. Of course, once the phone app is released, there will be more ways of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keybase lets you generate your own PGP key as follows, although you can use a pre-existing key too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ keybase pgp gen
Enter your real name, which will be publicly visible in your new key: Nishant Totla
Enter a public email address for your key: email1@email1.com
Enter another email address (or &amp;lt;enter&amp;gt; when done): email2@email2.com
Enter another email address (or &amp;lt;enter&amp;gt; when done):
Push an encrypted copy of your new secret key to the Keybase.io server? [Y/n] n
‚ñ∂ INFO PGP User ID: Nishant Totla &amp;lt;email1@email1.com&amp;gt; [primary]
‚ñ∂ INFO PGP User ID: &amp;lt;email2@email2.com&amp;gt;

‚ñ∂ INFO   4096-bit RSA key, ID 7EA5781C9B3D0C19, created 2016-04-07
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! This created a public-private key pair that I can now use to send encrypted messages to people, or sign stuff. The final line above is the public key fingerprint, also listed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/nishanttotla&#34;&gt;my Keybase account&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that you have the option to upload an encrypted copy of your private key to the Keybase server&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-trust-using-public-accounts:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;Adding Trust Using Public Accounts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, nobody has reason to trust the public key on my Keybase profile. Let&amp;rsquo;s use my Twitter account to remedy that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ keybase prove twitter nishanttotla
Please publicly tweet the following, and don&#39;t delete it:

Verifying myself: I am nishanttotla on Keybase.io. MNlQinOzwmC6qk6SOsO9cifW549sLaBqfK9t / https://keybase.io/nishanttotla/sigs/MNlQinOzwmC6qk6SOsO9cifW549sLaBqfK9t
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keybase generates a message signed with my private key, and asks me to tweet it. Now the Keybase server can confirm that the public key listed there matches the private key that generated the signed message on the tweet.
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Verifying myself: I am nishanttotla on Keybase.io. MNlQinOzwmC6qk6SOsO9cifW549sLaBqfK9t / &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/EkAZ8KA8si&#34;&gt;https://t.co/EkAZ8KA8si&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/718322059617681408&#34;&gt;April 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
Once Keybase finds the tweet, success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Check Twitter now? [Y/n] Y
Couldn&#39;t find posted proof.
Check Twitter again now? [Y/n] Y
‚ñ∂ NOTICE Success!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar proofs are generated for &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nishanttotla/06b5ea86a3a7a5ba94e83136079118ba&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/keybase.txt&#34;&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt;, etc. After all this, I&amp;rsquo;ve basically accomplished the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generated a new PGP key pair, with the private key on my laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generated a paper key that I could use to authenticate the Keybase client on more devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verified ownership of this key pair by posting to public websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are connected as shown below&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/keybase-io/keybase-graph.png&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Keybase constructs this Merkle tree for you, showing all your keys and claimed accounts. As more keys and devices are provisioned, the graph grows and becomes more complex. Notice that I added my second laptop (Nishant-Home-MBP) using my paper key (shove scrap).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to send and receive verified encrypted messages! It&amp;rsquo;s possible to use the client to create encrypted messages for a Keybase user (or even a non-user if you have their public key). I&amp;rsquo;ll send a message to &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/riyazdf&#34;&gt;Riyaz&lt;/a&gt;, who originally invited me to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can send the message using any email client, and only Riyaz would be able to read it. I hear that soon, it&amp;rsquo;ll also be possible to use Keybase to send the message. Keybase automatically managed the retrieval of his public key, verified social proofs etc. If anything had changed since I last tracked him, I&amp;rsquo;d get a meaningful error message &amp;ndash; very simple and non-complicated! I know Riyaz on Twitter and Github, hence trust his public key. What&amp;rsquo;s even cooler is I could have used his Twitter handle to do the same (it&amp;rsquo;s the same as the Keybase handle in this case, but it could have been different), since it&amp;rsquo;s connected to the PGP key. So basically&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ keybase pgp encrypt riyazdf@twitter -s -m &amp;quot;Hey it&#39;s me again.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really cool, because I&amp;rsquo;m essentially sending someone an encrypted message just using their Twitter handle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-impression:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;My Impression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck me about Keybase is great design. They&amp;rsquo;ve made the process of interacting with it extremely transparent and simple, which is brilliant for users who aren&amp;rsquo;t experts. The flexibility of being able to use a command line client is especially appreciated. For those who&amp;rsquo;d like to be even more careful, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to completely bypass the need for the client, and use command line scripts instead (which the website helps you construct). Note that you could also use the website for decryption and signing, if you chose to upload your private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security and encryption are difficult areas, and especially relevant in modern times. To make it available to everybody, Keybase have made tradeoffs between usability and security that are particularly neat. I suppose they will have to continue to strike that balance, and I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to see what they do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People, especially those already used to encryption might complain that Keybase is not perfect &amp;ndash; and it isn&amp;rsquo;t. But using social proofs is a powerful idea, and besides, you can always use Keybase the old fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-go-wrong:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;What Can Go Wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental idea is that you are signing proofs of your (public key) identity, and hosting them on other websites that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; own. But any of these websites (including Keybase) can be compromised, so how do you build security and trust on top of systems that are fundamentally &amp;ldquo;hackable&amp;rdquo;? The first of defense is that you just try to spread your identity across as many systems as possible, which makes it more robust overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-if-my-twitter-account-is-compromised:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;What if my Twitter account is compromised?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible to revoke a social proof from the Keybase site, and everybody will be able to see that you did so. What happens if all your social accounts are compromised, and need to be revoked? Well then your public key just became less trustworthy, and you already have other equally big (if not bigger) problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-if-my-keybase-account-is-compromised:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;What if my Keybase account is compromised?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can delete the proofs on the other websites and desert the Keybase account, leaving the intruder with an untrustworthy public key. You should be able to generate new keys, create a new account, and establish identity again. If you uploaded your private key to Keybase, you might be in trouble (don&amp;rsquo;t do it!). This is especially important since the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t support 2-Factor Authentication yet (shocking huh?), and you don&amp;rsquo;t want your private keys protected only by a passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Keybase server could also be compromised leading to undesirable outcomes, but there&amp;rsquo;s a better discussion of that &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/docs/server_security&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;online-security-is-still-your-responsibility:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;Online security is still your responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keybase is a trusted store for your public keys, but won&amp;rsquo;t make your online presence any more secure. For instance, your password reset email address is likely a single point of failure. Whoever gets access to your email account can hypothetically reset all other accounts and take control, which really is a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;can-you-protect-your-private-keys:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9&#34;&gt;Can you protect your private keys?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, everything has revolved around being able to protect your private key, but that&amp;rsquo;s another challenge in itself. Do other people use your laptop? Do you carelessly move your keys around? If your private key is compromised though, it&amp;rsquo;s still possible to generate a new pair and provide new social proofs, but all previously encrypted public messages continue to be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually for most users, it will come down to a tradeoff between convenience and strict security. Some will go old-school and not trust Keybase at all, others will trust fully and upload their private key too (don&amp;rsquo;t!). Several new questions will come up in time. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see how the law catches up with encryption being free and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I will say that I&amp;rsquo;m expecting good things from Keybase and will closely follow the company&amp;rsquo;s progress. It&amp;rsquo;s almost surprising that nobody implemented this idea sooner, although many good ideas appear that way in hindsight. Whether Keybase can stand the test of time, we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:1&#34;&gt;This is what is known as asymmetric-key encryption, because there are two different keys that have different roles. There&amp;rsquo;s also symmetric-key encryption, where both parties share one (secret) key, and the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Symmetric-key encryption is generally faster, but the challenge is sharing the key securely.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:2&#34;&gt;Tamper-evident means that if the message was tampered with along the way, it would be clear because it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible to decrypt it using the matching public or private key.

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:f04d57afc7abaa02bf8cb3c1249941a9:3&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t do it! There are several concerns, implications, and reasons around why one may want to do it (or not). &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/160&#34;&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; might be helpful.

Hash trees are useful because they allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. The Keybase graph has bidirectional edges though, so it implements such checking in both directions.

      <title>I&#39;m Not Here to Get Things Done</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/not-here-to-get-things-done/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2016 12:05:11 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/not-here-to-get-things-done/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bothra90&#34;&gt;Abhay&lt;/a&gt; recently, and he brought up a very interesting idea. He works at a software startup that&amp;rsquo;s still relatively small, which means that there&amp;rsquo;s a certain amount of pressure to make quick progress and produce results. This requires having to churn out functioning code on a regular basis. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s often easy to write code by pattern-matching or copying from other sources &amp;ndash; but an entirely different thing to fully understand, and internalize what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. In the long term, only the latter will stick with you, making you a better engineer. Obviously, there has to be a healthy balance between the two. The problem though is that companies are typically paying you to do the former, while not always incentivizing the latter. This is what he said about his job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;custom-quote&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h1 class=&#34;icon-quote-left&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not here to get things done. I&#39;m here to learn. Things will get done as a side-effect of what I learn.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that it&amp;rsquo;s largely your responsibility to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re learning, and not succumbing to the pressure to show progress. The reason I liked his point of view was because it&amp;rsquo;s a good attitude to have, and helps to set expectations. In my own work, I have certainly written code I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand, had it compile and pass all tests. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel accomplished doing that, but important to remember it&amp;rsquo;s not the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So Who Wants to Volunteer?</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/who-wants-to-volunteer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 15:01:35 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/who-wants-to-volunteer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Yoga class, our instructor wanted to demonstrate a certain asana (pose). She could have easily done it herself, but she wanted a volunteer, perhaps so that she could point out common mistakes people make in this asana. So she asked &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;who wants to volunteer?&amp;rdquo;. As is common in such a situation, most people look around trying to deflect attention. I often do that too, but this time I just raised my hand, albeit a little reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I did an OK job being a model, but there was a useful lesson there &amp;ndash; even though being the center of attention was uncomfortable, I got more feedback on my posture than I normally would. The attention went away as the others got busy with trying the asana on their own, but the feedback stayed &amp;ndash; a net win for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s useful to apply this little idea on other situations in life where we often forgo learning for comfort. The position of comfort is hard to leave, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to consciously make the choice to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Moved to a Static Website</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/why-i-moved-to-static-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 00:52:35 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/why-i-moved-to-static-website/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained a personal website/blog for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked writing, because I consider it to be a natural extension of thinking. While I&amp;rsquo;m not great with words, I do love keeping track of things I learn &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s really what a blog means to me. Over time, I went through several iterations to find the right platform. Things always revolved around WordPress, and regardless of what I tried, the experience of writing never got much better. What&amp;rsquo;s more, there was actually a huge overhead to log into WordPress, not get turned off by the painfully slow interface, and then finally type a post &amp;ndash; only to require a new plugin for each added functionality, which made the website progressively slower. I tried optimizing using several tricks, but at the end of the day I hated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-site-generators:57a527704b389062d91c7b9be304d601&#34;&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was familiar with static site generators &amp;ndash; tools that generate your website for you using some basic definitions, but never thought they could work for me. Around two months ago, I started exploring further, and found that the ecosystem had &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com/&#34;&gt;grown a lot&lt;/a&gt; since I last checked. Still, it seemed like a lot of work with unclear advantages, until &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/prakharsriv9&#34;&gt;Prakhar&lt;/a&gt; fully convinced me to take the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla&#34;&gt;@nishanttotla&lt;/a&gt; I whole-heartedly support this! No DB, editing in your fav text-editor and painless + free deployments. It can&amp;#39;t get better.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Prakhar Srivastav (@prakharsriv9) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/prakharsriv9/status/697481406956572672&#34;&gt;February 10, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is this website, served using the static site generator &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, and hosted on Github&amp;rsquo;s servers using Github pages. I built it on top of the hard work already done by Prakhar, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful to him for licensing his work generously. My repo is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nishanttotla/hugo-blog-skeleton&#34; title=&#34;Source code&#34;&gt;Github&lt;i class=&#34;icon-github-circled&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I appreciate contributions (issues/comments/PRs/anything else). Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far, and comparisons with WordPress + &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/&#34;&gt;BlueHost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-of-a-static-site:57a527704b389062d91c7b9be304d601&#34;&gt;Advantages of a Static Site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; - Static HTML can be loaded really fast, and is easy to cache. By comparison, WordPress uses a database to serve content that adds latency, and caching is much more complex. Faster websites are also more likely to have &lt;a href=&#34;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html&#34;&gt;better search ranking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; - WordPress has been known to have several security vulnerabilities, and generally has a wider attack surface since it needs a database and server to work. I&amp;rsquo;m no security expert, and always worried about exposing my site to attacks. BlueHost in addition constantly sent me emails about security updates, many of which I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand or want to care about. By contrast, a static site can be hosted practically anywhere (which for me means more secure locations like Github pages or AWS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; - A HUGE difference! A BlueHost web hosting account cost me about $50 per year, in addition to ~$10 for the domain name. Now I just pay for the domain, while web hosting is free with Github pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability&lt;/strong&gt; - Static HTML can be hosted literally anywhere with minimal to no setup. This makes it easy to not get locked into to a specific hosting provider or environment, and move quickly if necessary. Granted that WordPress also provides portability, but it&amp;rsquo;s not equally easy to set up everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Experience&lt;/strong&gt; - Damn good! To be honest, BlueHost run their business like a bank, with a clunky website and poor support, and a file manager straight out of the 90s. To run WordPress on top of that is a nightmare. Now, all my content is neatly versioned using Git and safe from corruption. I can write blog posts in markdown syntax on my favorite text editor (including offline), making it that much easier to write them (this was the biggest draw for me). It&amp;rsquo;s also easier for other people to contribute to my blog now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-chose-hugo:57a527704b389062d91c7b9be304d601&#34;&gt;Why I chose Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many static site generators out there, including some really popular ones like &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org/&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Hugo is relatively new, with a smaller ecosystem, but has several things going for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to install &amp;ndash; just download a single binary and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go! As a result, Hugo is easier to update too. By comparison, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Jekyll to build cleanly at all, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a Ruby mess on my computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo is fast. It generates content much faster and provides live feedback while editing posts locally. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize speed was a big deal initially, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how frustrating it would be if each change I made took several seconds (or more) to render.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Hugo is relatively new, it might take more work to get what you want. It also lacks a plugin system. But none of these were problems for me, and overall I&amp;rsquo;ve been very happy with my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-sites-may-not-be-for-everyone:57a527704b389062d91c7b9be304d601&#34;&gt;Static Sites may not be for Everyone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, if this got you excited, and you want to build your own static site, there are a few caveats to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a good static site is likely to be more work, and takes a certain amount of comfort with web design. You also need to set up your own workflow which might be hard if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with programming tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static websites won&amp;rsquo;t offer full dynamic functionality the way a WordPress site can, so you need to think about what you really need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall writing experience might not appeal to you after all, if you prefer using WYSIWYG editors and writing tools (although considering the power of static site generators and modern text editors, I&amp;rsquo;m not unhappy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be difficult to use other devices to write posts, depending on how complex it is to set up the development environment. Hugo makes it easy, but there can still be challenges with versioning, or when extra tools are needed. At the very least, editing on the phone will be difficult (unlike WordPress).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-conclusion:57a527704b389062d91c7b9be304d601&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have much more to say, except that to write a blog post now, all I need to do is type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hugo new blog/post-slug.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in my terminal, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to start editing! It&amp;rsquo;s great for taking notes, quickly recording ideas, and eventually sharing them as blog posts, which only takes a simple &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;. This for me is the biggest win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to report any issues in the comments, or on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nishanttotla/hugo-blog-skeleton&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to help if you want to set up your own static site. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun! üò∏&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Code Inside a VM</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/building-code-inside-vm/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2016 13:35:12 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This post is based on the workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve been employing during my day to day work at Docker. When I first started, I chose to get a 13&amp;rsquo; Macbook Pro, which is a pretty solid machine to own. But a lot of the compiling and testing I needed to do needed a Linux distribution, so I had two options &amp;ndash; install Linux or use a Virtual Machine (VM). Installing VirtualBox and using a simple Ubuntu VM is a fairly straightforward solution, but there were two problems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really wanted to continue writing code on OSX (personal preference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think VirtualBox is very stable, and it would be a disaster to lose my work if something bad happened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution was the continue writing code on the Mac, but build it inside the VM &amp;ndash; a win-win. But how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first solution I came up with involved using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, a very popular file synchronization tool for Unix-like systems. I set up one folder called &lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt; on my Mac, and one on the VM, and used &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; to copy files from one to the other. Any changes were automatically detected using &lt;code&gt;inotify&lt;/code&gt; (or similar tools), and triggered a sync. I won&amp;rsquo;t describe that in detail because it&amp;rsquo;s not only fragile and prone to corruption&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but also too hard to set up&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. All this was before I discovered that I could mount folders (duh) and create a relatively stable solution. If this is something you&amp;rsquo;re interested in too, read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-a-mounted-folder-on-a-virtualbox-vm:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900&#34;&gt;Setting up a mounted folder on a VirtualBox VM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to create a VM using your Linux distribution of choice. I use Ubuntu 14.04 right now, but the setup should work in most cases. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed the VM, make sure you install &lt;code&gt;openssh-server&lt;/code&gt; to be able to SSH into it from the host&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other requirement is Guest Additions, without which mounting won&amp;rsquo;t work. It&amp;rsquo;s straightforward to install, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm&#34;&gt;several articles&lt;/a&gt; online explain how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to create a mounted folder. Right click on the VM and go to Settings, under Shared Folders. There, mount your folder of choice as a Machine Folder, and give it a name. I mount the &lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt; folder in my home directory, and call the mount &lt;code&gt;workmac&lt;/code&gt; (any name is fine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img data-action=&#34;zoom&#34; src=&#34;http://nishanttotla.com/images/vbox-shared-folder.png&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, SSH into the VM, then create a folder, which will be the mount point for the host folder. In my case, it&amp;rsquo;s in the home directory  and called &lt;code&gt;work-vm&lt;/code&gt;. The shared folder is mounted with 770 permissions with &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; user and &lt;code&gt;vboxsf&lt;/code&gt; as the group. This is an inconvenience since you (the user) also want to have those permissions. This is done by adding the user to to &lt;code&gt;vboxsf&lt;/code&gt; group as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo usermod -aG vboxsf $(whoami)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, mount the folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$(id -g) workmac work-vm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the mount and directory names as appropriate for you. And that&amp;rsquo;s it! Now you should be able to access a mirror of the host folder inside the VM without any of the messy &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; scripts. Note that if you reboot the VM, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to run the mount command again &amp;ndash; a requirement you can surpass by adding the line to your &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-of-this-setup:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900&#34;&gt;Advantages of this setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an extremely simple setup that has worked for me (and others I helped) each time. While for me, the reasons to do this centered around personal preference, I feel there are at least two good reasons to do it anyway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The environment inside a VM can be precisely controlled, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to depend on, or mess with the host (Mac). It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to upgrade, or redo if things are failing. This also makes it easy to quickly experiment with different build environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The setup is easier to reproduce and share with someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, my use cases haven&amp;rsquo;t presented any disadvantages, though I suspect there could be situations where this couldn&amp;rsquo;t work. Feel free to share your experiences in the comments. The next step I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore would be to create a similar dev environment &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/05/19/docker-osx-dev/&#34;&gt;using Docker&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:2&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised I even had to patience to go through all the steps.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:3&#34;&gt;To save some trouble if your Mac reboots, you might want to set a static IP address for the VM. How to do that is beyond the scope of this post.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:0845bcb07a42949b6056d62ad8760900:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to hire a software engineer for a company you work with, and are interested in my background, please read the following to get a sense of what kind of work and culture I value. If you don&amp;rsquo;t think your company is a good fit, then just don&amp;rsquo;t send me that email, and save both of us some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;roles:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;Roles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m primarily a software engineer, I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily only looking for roles that involve writing code. In the future, I would like to explore career paths that offer alternative kinds of responsibilities, such as management or a mixture of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;rsquo;t work on a technology or area that I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in. I care about solving problems that make people&amp;rsquo;s lives better, or enable them to do better work. Having challenging technical problems to solve along the way in addition is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also prefer working with engineers who are interested in getting better at what they do, and in helping others do the same. Unfortunately, wanting to be an expert is your area isn&amp;rsquo;t a required quality for software engineers, but I strongly prefer working with such people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;culture:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say the least, company culture matters to me immensely. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but the free beer and happy hours isn&amp;rsquo;t what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. I mean priorities that affect people. Here are some questions for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company encourage transparency? Are all employees seen as valuable members of the team, and encouraged to ask questions and participate? To engage in candid conversation about the company both inside and outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company value diversity in the team at all levels of the hierarchy? Do you make real efforts to make it happen &amp;ndash; not only women but people of color and members of non-privileged classes? I understand if your team doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect this yet, but if you think it means lowering the bar, or it just isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority right now, then our conversation likely ends here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company value learning and personal growth for all employees? I will not work at a company that just wants to &amp;ldquo;get things done&amp;rdquo;. I value environments where my co-workers like to think and learn about things outside their comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your company create a respectful and safe environment for everybody to thrive? How are grievances or conflicts addressed? Do people feel like they truly &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo;, or is the founding team a clique full of entitled individuals who feel they&amp;rsquo;re a notch above everyone else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-good:d826597240714a020489db2dc726419c&#34;&gt;All Good?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach out to me via &lt;a title=&#34;Linkedin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishanttotla&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-linkedin&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&#34;Email&#34; href=&#34;mailto:nishanttotla@gmail.com&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;icon-gmail&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No cold calling please, especially on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in one city, with a little occasional travel. I then spent 6 years away from home. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I&amp;rsquo;ve lived since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I&amp;rsquo;d travel to at least one new country each year. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve managed that, but here&amp;rsquo;s a list of all the countries (non-transit) I&amp;rsquo;ve visited so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mauritius (2004)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Arab Emirates (2004, 2005)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switzerland (2005, 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vietnam (2008)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russia (2009)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kazakhstan (2009)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austria (2010, 2011)&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Czech Republic (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy (2010, 2013)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vatican City (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;France (2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belgium (2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netherlands (2011)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cities-visited:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540&#34;&gt;Cities Visited&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to keep track of all cities that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to on a map. This of course doesn&amp;rsquo;t include transit, but only actual cities that I set foot in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:7a235a22ac4f99f88c5f598d8d355540:2&#34;&gt;I briefly visited in March 2012, before moving in August of the same year.

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful. It‚Äôs overwhelming to begin with, but everything that‚Äôs worthwhile has to start somewhere! This is obviously not a complete list, but hopefully the union of content within all entries on the list will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015 Year in Review</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Are you already sick of people writing their yearly review posts? I bet! I‚Äôm going to add more more to the pile though, but mostly as a milestone for myself, and for others who might find value in reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I have to say that 2015 has been the most unusual year of my life. I‚Äôve experienced many different things and changed a lot as a person. This is also the year when I finally decided and went through the process of quitting grad school to venture out into the real world. I‚Äôll try to keep it short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;depression-and-personal-growth:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Depression and Personal Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started in late 2014 as a series of depressive episodes turned into a full-blown depression that lasted for most of 2015. It affected nearly every area of my life, most notably my ability to work. Research suffered and I failed to make any meaningful progress, which in turn only made it harder to recover. My ability to make friends, and keep in touch with existing ones also took a hit as I became increasingly lonely. It took a lot of time to accept this and start taking steps to get better, and I‚Äôm still on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it has been a very troubling period where I came in touch with some of the darkest emotions in me, it has also been full of trememdous learning about self and personal growth. It taught me to take a hard look at my priorities. It showed me which people are really well-wishers and were willing to help when I needed it most. I realized the value of community and investing in relationships, something I‚Äôd never thought important because I believed I could survive on my own. It also made me a lot more empathetic to the suffering of other people, and I think I emerge from it a better person. Probably more cynical, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;world-view:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;World View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a consequence of my struggles, I became much more attuned to the struggles of other people, in particular underprivileged groups. I realized that the world isn‚Äôt always a fair place, and is heavily biased in favor of those already predisposed to success. Causes like equality (gender, race etc.) gained new meaning for me, and my opinions of right and wrong evolved to a large extent. I also started participating in discussions and voicing opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;work:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think I was ever as productive in grad school as I would like, but 2015 turned out to be the tipping point. Things got to a stage where my lack of progress had become a chronic problem and nothing I was trying seemed to work. Changing research groups didn‚Äôt seem quite possible then, so leaving grad school completely was the only plausible option. It took me a while to come to terms with the decision, but it became clearer as time passed. I had some great interviews and got several job offers which was good for my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/docker&#34;&gt;@docker&lt;/a&gt; later this year! Super excited, looking forward to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aluzzardi&#34;&gt;@aluzzardi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vieux&#34;&gt;@vieux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abronan&#34;&gt;@abronan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sam_alba&#34;&gt;@sam_alba&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/647555264699219968&#34;&gt;September 25, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the battle was only half won, and consistent efforts to gain back my lost productivity have finally bore some fruit, and I feel confident I can do great things with my new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;travel:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel wise, 2015 was a decent year. I managed to stick to my resolution of visiting at least one new country each year. This year, it was an amazing summer trip to the UK (England+Scotland), and a (just concluded) winter trip to Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Goodbye Hawaii, it&amp;#39;s been a meaningful trip! Time to go back to normal life and start afresh. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/NzS1Pnftk4&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NzS1Pnftk4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Traveler Boy (@nrt_travel) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nrt_travel/status/682771096320409602&#34;&gt;January 1, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few other short trips too, but not nearly enough! The overwhelming guilt that comes from not being productive is a big enemy of travel, and I‚Äôve been trying hard to control it. Still, I‚Äôm proud and happy for the travel I managed to do, but looking forward to all the more that I will do in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;health:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped running long distances after the hip injury I had in late 2014, hoping to get to its root before starting again. I picked up biking instead and started riding long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having learned my lesson from running, I built up mileage too much too soon, and ended up with an overuse injury to the back that would keep me out for much of the year. What finally did put me in touch with my body was picking up Yoga, which not only showed me how ill-prepared I was to go through extreme physical stresses, but also gave me a framework to think about how to treat my body and be gentle with it. Most importantly, to listen to my body. Mental stress also contributed most likely, and is as much part of overall recovery as anything else. I hope to take these learnings into the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-2016:b28868909f74bdd4f426ebee08db720a&#34;&gt;In 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my work is laid out clearly. I need to rediscover my productivity by performing well at work, while simultaneously giving more importance to community both in my personal and professional lives. I will travel more. I will recover from my injuries and respect my body. I will remember to apply everything I‚Äôve learned the hard way this year to similar problems. Life isn‚Äôt going to be any easier, but I will be wiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I write this post next year, I hope there will be more positivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Off to Hawaii - a Good End to a Miserable Year</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/off-to-hawaii/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2015 will go down as the worst year in my life so far, no doubts about that! It has been a year when I suffered a lot, learned some hard lessons, and had to face several uncomfortable truths about myself. I‚Äôve battled terrifying depression and felt things I wasn‚Äôt ready to handle. As painful as that has been, I‚Äôm glad to be ending the year right ‚Äì by taking a break from everything, and heading to Hawaii on my first real solo trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Booked tickets to Hawaii today, leaving in 5 days!! üôåüôåüôå Now gotta figure the rest out. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/678304771921436672&#34;&gt;December 19, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm leaving tomorrow, for 8 days, and relishing the opportunity to relax, contemplate, and plan for the coming year. I‚Äôm going to spend a few days in Honolulu, and the rest living on an organic farm not far from some hills. I plan to run, hike, eat, read, and swim at the beach. I‚Äôll do what I want, go where I like. There will be plenty of time to write too, and prepare for my new job which I start soon after returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully intend to cut down social media use during the stay, and concentrate on the moment. The stress and poor lifestyle during 2015 have diminished my focus and severely affected my ability to think deeply about hard problems. I want to start recovering some of that. For starters, I have a book to read, along with some exciting new research papers. Hoping to have a great trip!&lt;/p&gt;
