        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I started posting these yearly review posts two years ago, and each time I&rsquo;ve failed
to finish before the New Year&rsquo;s Eve. This time is no different. Regardless, I think
the effort is worthwhile and rewarding, especially for a cynical person like me who
often has a hard time appreciating the good things in life. Unlike the doom
and gloom of 2015 and 2016, my hindsight perception of 2017 is much more positive.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t say the year was smooth sailing all through, it has ended on a good note
for me because of some recent decisions. I have also been able to
be comfortable with myself at a level I never managed before. All of this is great news
and I cannot wait to take on new things in 2018, and continue some I started last year.</p>

<p>In no particular order, here&rsquo;s an incomplete list of highlights<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, the big one &ndash; I <a href="/blog/moving-to-san-francisco/">moved to San Francisco</a>! For a
while I had been feeling a lot of personal stagnation, and desperately wanted to move to
break out of it. There were many mixed feelings around this, with some positives and
negatives, but overall I&rsquo;m proud I did it. I&rsquo;ve hosted parties, collected artwork, and
created a space I feel good about. The move also shook me out of my physical lethargy,
and I found a new gym and trainer, which has done great things for my overall well-being.
I feel like I&rsquo;m now moving past my usual sob story of physical injuries from old activities.</p></li>

<li><p>In 2017, I started pursuing acting and other performance arts! I did a few <a href="/blog/about-acting-class/">acting classes</a> and a clowning class at the Berkeley Repertory Theater, and engaged
with several artistic people and activities. This meant more shows, new friends, and
a variety of experiences I had sorely missed. This allowed me to channel my
creativity that trickled down into other parts of life. If you met me in person, maybe you
noticed I&rsquo;ve been more freely expressive. While my attempts at auditioning for plays
bombed spectacularly, I ended the year with an open-mic performance that was described
by the organizer as the &ldquo;sleeper hit of the night&rdquo;.</p></li>
</ul>

</figure>

<ul>
<li>Part of exercising the creative muscle for me was photography. I&rsquo;m used to clicking
a lot of photos in general, but this year I spent much time thinking about them
also. For now, I&rsquo;ve found my aesthetic, which could loosely be described as trying
to look for abstract moods in everyday scenes, in a somewhat post-impressionist
sense. I&rsquo;m going to continue more of that this year now that I have bought a better
camera. Plus there&rsquo;s my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fireescapephotos/">Instagram account about fire escapes</a> that you want to follow.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <img class="lazy" data-action="zoom" data-src="/images/2017-year-in-review/bikaner.jpg" style="width:70%;"></img>

</figure>

<ul>
<li><p>A common theme of much of my writing is Depression, which has troubled me for long
enough now that it feels like a part of my reality for as long as I can remember. I also
remember several false dawns when I thought I had overcome it, only to fall back
into familiar bad habits again. But, I&rsquo;ve had significant
success in the last 2-3 months, and this time feels different.
I&rsquo;d write more about it, but I&rsquo;m choosing not to
because I&rsquo;m avoiding this self-pity thing currently, plus we have a shitty culture
that trivializes mental health issues and judges those who dare to talk openly about them.
Ask me in person to know what&rsquo;s working for me currently.</p></li>

<li><p>Being Depressed has side-effects™. The most troubling for me over time have been
related to socialization and personal relationships. Last year, I managed to get
into a better frame of mind wrt expectations from and responsibilities towards
friends, particularly old ones. I also got comfortable calling new people my close
friends, and that has been a significant boost for my happiness.</p></li>

<li><p>In 2017, I experimented with my appearance. This included
coloring my hair and nails, and trying out more dressing styles than I&rsquo;m normally used
to. In a certain sense, I&rsquo;ve embraced my femininity and gotten more
comfortable about it. What has been a huge surprise though, is how much happier I
feel breaking gender norms, than sticking around with a limited range of behaviors
I was taught growing up.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>If I had to mark down one experience from the year as being the most memorable, it
would probably be <a href="/experiences/first-total-solar-eclipse/">watching the total solar eclipse</a> back in August. A lot of effort went into making the
two minutes of totality possible, but it was packed with overwhelming emotion. I&rsquo;d
do it all again in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<li><p>I failed to meet my travel goal of visiting at least one new country every calendar
year<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. That was okay though, because I still managed a very memorable trip to
India in December (besides, exploring a new area of India is roughly the same
as visiting a new country right?). Overall, trips were shorter and less planned out. I often felt much less excitement about visiting places than in the past.
Among travels that stood out in the year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bangalore (January) for a meetup talk and some socializing.</li>
<li>New Orleans (March) to spend a few days submerged in good jazz.</li>
<li>Austin (April) where I spent a week for work and pleasure.</li>
<li>Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks (May), where I hiked to the top of Angels Landing.</li>
<li>Yosemite National Park (June) to climb the Half Dome cables.</li>
<li>Acadia National Park (June) which was the furthest I&rsquo;ve been north-east.</li>
<li>New York City (June) where I spent a few days working remotely and enjoying several shows (including a live taping of the Colbert show and seeing Trevor Noah and Laurie Metcalf up close!).</li>
<li><a href="/experiences/portland-july-2017/">Portland</a> (July) for the memorable bachelorette trip of a close friend.</li>
<li>Portland (August) again for the total solar eclipse. This included an Amtrak ride on the Coastal Starlight, and a backbreaking overnight drive back because we missed the return flight.</li>
<li>Sonoma County, California (September) for a hot air balloon ride!</li>
<li>Chicago (September) to visit a friend and explore magnificent architecture.</li>
<li>Moab and Arches National Park (October) for a couple of friends&rsquo; bachelor trip.</li>
<li>Bikaner (December) for a wedding and a great time.</li>
<li>Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh (December) to visit some temples with family.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I spent a lot of time exploring the city of San Francisco and its culture in depth, something I&rsquo;d
never really done before. I enjoyed that a lot, and it strengthened my convictions
that I&rsquo;m a city person through and through.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Professionally, I continued working at Docker and gave a big talk at DockerCon 2017 in
Austin, Texas. Other than that, it was business as usual, even though I&rsquo;ve been thinking hard and seriously about longer term professional goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I don&rsquo;t want to write much, but add that I ended <a href="/blog/2016-year-in-review/">last year&rsquo;s post</a>
with &ldquo;For too long now, life has felt like someone else in the driver&rsquo;s seat, and I want to end that&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m grateful that this actually happened to a noticeable extent, so I am
looking forward to what comes my way in 2018.</p>
