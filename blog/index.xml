      <description>A little over two weeks ago, I got my hair colored red. Not completely, just highlights, but very prominent highlights. Nothing unique because millions of people do this sort of thing, so the only reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing about it is because I can. Kind of the same reason why I colored my hair. It had been on my mind since last year, but the stars started aligning a month ago when a friend referred me to a place in Oakland.</description>

      <title>On Being a Tourist in India</title>

      <description>I recently got back to California after spending four full weeks in India. My previous trip was two years ago, at the end of 2014. Until moving to the US in 2012, I&amp;rsquo;d only ever lived in India. Immediately after moving, life in California seemed very attractive, especially by virtue of the things India could not offer (primarily better facilities, a more peaceful lifestyle, and opportunities for individual growth). Whenever I visited India after that, I&amp;rsquo;d often complain about the lack of infrastructure, pollution, poor traffic, general disorder, and a host of other problems that might affect any developing country.</description>

      <title>I was Asked to Give a Motivational Speech</title>

      <description>On December 18, 2016, my parents celebrated the 25th anniversary of Totla Hospital. It has been a long and impressive journey for them, starting out from literally nothing when they arrived in Aurangabad, to having built a very successful and highly respected hospital in the city. To celebrate this anniversary, they had organized a grand function, inviting a lot of former patients, friends, family, and others out of the gigantic community they&amp;rsquo;ve built during this time.</description>

      <description>Precisely a year ago, I went to Hawaii to try and regain some sanity after what was a terrible 2015. It offered little apart from endless pain, suffering, depression, lack of community, and an uncontrollable feeling of helplessness. So much so that the second half of the Hawaii trip was full of panic attacks and attempts to cut the trip short. I was due to start a new job upon returning, and my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis was still pending.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to have traveled extensively during the Fall of 2016. A good chunk of that travel was because of work. Back in September, I visited London and St. Louis (Missouri), and attended three different conferences. Later in October, I flew back to Europe, this time to Berlin to attend my fourth conference in two months1. This post focuses on the conferences. I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about the sightseeing I did in future posts.</description>

      <title>Signing Git Commits with a GPG Key</title>
      <link>http://nishanttotla.com/blog/signing-git-commits-gpg/</link>

      <description>In my last post, I described public key encryption and how you can generate new PGP keys using Keybase. That was just a start, and PGP keys have several uses. One of the first things I wanted to do was to start signing all my Git commits.
Why Sign Commits? Recent versions of Git (v1.7.9 and above) introduced the ability to sign commits using a GPG key. A signed commit can be verified to make sure that you wrote the code that you claim you did.</description>

      <title>Playing with Keybase.io</title>

      <description>I have to admit, despite having spent so many years studying Computer Science, my understanding of security and modern best practices is pretty shabby. I&amp;rsquo;m fixing that now, and it was a perfect opportunity when a friend invited me to try keybase.io. It&amp;rsquo;s still an Alpha product, and invite-only (or sign up and join the waitlist). I learned new things while trying it out, and wanted to write about it.</description>

      <title>Why I Moved to a Static Website</title>

      <description>As some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained a personal website/blog for a few years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked writing, because I consider it to be a natural extension of thinking. While I&amp;rsquo;m not great with words, I do love keeping track of things I learn &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s really what a blog means to me. Over time, I went through several iterations to find the right platform. Things always revolved around WordPress, and regardless of what I tried, the experience of writing never got much better.</description>

      <title>Building Code Inside a VM</title>

      <description>This post is based on the workflow I&amp;rsquo;ve been employing during my day to day work at Docker. When I first started, I chose to get a 13&amp;rsquo; Macbook Pro, which is a pretty solid machine to own. But a lot of the compiling and testing I needed to do needed a Linux distribution, so I had two options &amp;ndash; install Linux or use a Virtual Machine (VM). Installing VirtualBox and using a simple Ubuntu VM is a fairly straightforward solution, but there were two problems</description>

      <description>I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.
In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful.</description>

      <description>Are you already sick of people writing their yearly review posts? I bet! I’m going to add more more to the pile though, but mostly as a milestone for myself, and for others who might find value in reading it.
To start, I have to say that 2015 has been the most unusual year of my life. I’ve experienced many different things and changed a lot as a person. This is also the year when I finally decided and went through the process of quitting grad school to venture out into the real world.</description>

      <title>Off to Hawaii - a Good End to a Miserable Year</title>

      <description>2015 will go down as the worst year in my life so far, no doubts about that! It has been a year when I suffered a lot, learned some hard lessons, and had to face several uncomfortable truths about myself. I’ve battled terrifying depression and felt things I wasn’t ready to handle. As painful as that has been, I’m glad to be ending the year right – by taking a break from everything, and heading to Hawaii on my first real solo trip.</description>

      <title>India&#39;s Undercurrent of Propaganda</title>

      <description>India is currently at an interesting political standpoint. We finally have a single party forming the central government without needing support from other parties (last this happened was in 1984). The average Indian person seems to be much more aware and concerned about the political situation, and invested in the country’s future, especially young people. All of this is a major shift compared to a few years ago. There have been several contributing factors – dissatisfaction with the UPA govt.</description>

      <title>Learning about Empathy</title>

      <description>Empathy is such a simple concept to understand, yet so difficult to practice! Kids are taught about it. The word itself is lazily thrown around, assuming everyone knows how to empathize, that it’s something we’re naturally good at. Well we’re not! Even if we care enough to look outside our own busy lives to try and want to empathize with someone, it’s too easy to fall into the trap of making judgments or believing we know everything about another person’s situation.</description>

      <description>Sunday, March 28, 2004 : Arsenal vs Manchester United at Highbury, London was the first live football game I watched (on TV, of course). I’d only ever followed cricket before that and played some football, but this was unlike anything I knew in sport. It was fast and full of action. These players were really passionate and the tension was palpable. Then on 50 minutes, Arsenal’s number 14 scored from a brilliant long range effort, a stunning goal by any standard!</description>

      <description>This summer, I was interviewing at several companies. Among other things, it involved a lot of travel, and there was little I could do while traveling. If I was driving, I’d mostly listen to my usual Spotify playlists, although they got boring pretty soon. Taking the train allowed me to read in addition, but I’d usually get distracted or fall asleep since the interviews were exhausting. Soon enough, all this travel time started feeling wasteful, but I wanted to reclaim it, so I constantly tried to find ways to engage in something productive, or learn something new.</description>

      <title>Eight Lessons I Learned in College</title>

      <description>I’m writing a post after around five months! Whoa! What a ride the last semester has been! I’ve now graduated (provided they give me my degree) from one of the best colleges in India, with new hopes and dreams, some knowledge, passion and a lot of friends. The past few months have been a blur, and I’ve done loads of new things. Most importantly, I’ve had the opportunity to think about and look at all that I accomplished (or failed to accomplish) during college, I’ve thought about where my motivations lie, what I want from life and ultimately how I’m going to achieve that.</description>
